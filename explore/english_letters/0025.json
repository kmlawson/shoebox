      "<p>A worker run over by the train and cut into pieces.</p></p>\n<p>On the railroad tracks outside Arildsl&oslash;kken a sad accident happened yesterday, when railroad worker Markus Holm was run over by the train and crushed to death.</p></p>\n<p>The victim was working on transporting gravel across the lines for filling in towards the river.<span>&nbsp; </span>When the freight train approached around 4:30 he was in the process of pushing the wheelbarrow across the line.<span>&nbsp; </span>His friends who saw the danger called out to him, without him taking notice of that.<span>&nbsp; </span>He could probably have escaped but unfortunately he stumbled while he managed to get the wheelbarrow across the line and the locomotive went over him.<span>&nbsp; </span>He was literally cut into pieces by the wheel, both legs and an arm were severed, and his head and abdomen horribly mutilated.</p></p>\n<p>The body was taken to Skandsen station and from there to the hospital mortuary.<span>&nbsp; </span>The deceased was in his 40&rsquo;s and leaves behind a wife and 7 children 6 of whom are unconfirmed.<span>&nbsp; </span>The family lives in the old lasareth building in Ilsviken <em>(Ilen Bay</em>). <span>&nbsp;</span></p></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p></p>"
