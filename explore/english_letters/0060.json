      "<p>It was nice to hear that you wanted a letter from me.<span>&nbsp; </span>I have gotten big since you last saw me.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then I was kicking and screaming in my cradle.<span>&nbsp; </span>But that was 11 years ago.<span>&nbsp; </span>I recently became a girl scout with the K.F.W.K.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;m terribly wild and unruly. I&rsquo;m in 5<sup>th</sup> grade at Bisbehaugen school which is located just up the road from us.<span>&nbsp; </span>Every afternoon I&rsquo;m outside skiing, skating or sledding that is if I&rsquo;m not busy doing home work, or at my sewing club with my needle work.<span>&nbsp; </span>And on Sundays I ski way up into the coutry with some of my friends.<span>&nbsp; </span>I have many friends 5 or 6 of them.<span>&nbsp; </span>During the day I&rsquo;m at school untill 2.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;ll have my picture taken soon and then I&rsquo;ll let you have a picture of me too.<span>&nbsp; </span>I don&rsquo;t have any more to tell you this time, but there will be more next time.</p></p>\n<p>With love</p></p>\n<p>Your Sonja Holm</p></p>"
