      "<p>Many thanks for your letter to me.<span>&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;s so shameful of me that I haven&rsquo;t written before, but writing letters is a big effort.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thank you for the yarn you sent, but now we can buy as much yarn as we like up here too.<span>&nbsp; </span>Well I imagine you felt a little strange when you heard that father had died.<span>&nbsp; </span>Yes it was terribly sad, but I&rsquo;m so glad he was let go, as he was very sick, and we don&rsquo;t need to feel bad because he died in such a secure and content way.<span>&nbsp; </span>He was well prepared to die, and that&rsquo;s the best thing.<span>&nbsp; </span>He came down with eczema all over his body, and the liquid from the sores was running all down his body all the way down into his slippers, so you can imagine how he suffered.<span>&nbsp; </span>Mother took it very sensibly.<span>&nbsp; </span>She had to comfort us, instead of us comforting her.<span>&nbsp; </span>All 10 of us siblings were at home and it was so nice for us all to meet.<span>&nbsp; </span>They&rsquo;re all so good and kind to mother, they almost carry her on their hands, and they don&rsquo;t know the best thing to do for her.<span>&nbsp; </span>She&rsquo;s about to move in with Olaf now.<span>&nbsp; </span>He&rsquo;s the one who&rsquo;s going to keep her now that she&rsquo;s been left alone. <span>&nbsp;</span>If only I&rsquo;d had a bigger house I would have kept her with me, but unfortunately I can&rsquo;t do that yet.<span>&nbsp; </span>My husband works with the railroads, and I&rsquo;m thinking about buying a dry goods store in town.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;ll come to pass, but we&rsquo;ll see. Otherwise all of ours are doing well.<span>&nbsp; </span>Sverre has opened a jeweler&rsquo;s repair shop, and he has a lot of work.<span>&nbsp; </span>Well this was just quickly a few words.<span>&nbsp; </span>I have so many I need to write to, so there won&rsquo;t be much for each.<span>&nbsp; </span>Today is mother&rsquo;s birthday, she&rsquo;s 76 today.<span>&nbsp; </span>They were so cute the two little children you sent a picture of.<span>&nbsp; </span>They looked like a bridal couple.<span>&nbsp; </span>It was really beautiful.<span>&nbsp; </span>Say hello to all of yours from all of us here. <span>&nbsp;</span>It&rsquo;s so much fun to hear from America.</p></p>\n<p>Goodbye everyone.</p></p>\n<p>Best wishes from us three.</p></p>\n<p>Hilma<span>&nbsp; </span>Ole<span>&nbsp; </span>Frid Anne!</p></p>"
