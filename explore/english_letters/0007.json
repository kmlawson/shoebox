We wont be able to get the package out until Monday the 19<sup>th</sup> of May as the post office is closed till then.<span>&nbsp; </span>As soon as we&rsquo;ve picked it up and if it is what uncle has sent to Narvik, we&rsquo;ll write to him.<span>&nbsp; </span>You must tell him this.<span>&nbsp; </span>I think it is that package arriving now.</p></p>\n<p>Write to us again.<span>&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;s fun to get Amerika-letters.<span>&nbsp; </span>Also say hello to your children from us.</p></p>\n<p>Regards &Aring;goth</p></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p></p>"
