      "<p>Dear Alma and all Yours.</p></p>\n<p>Thank you for the Christmas greeting we got.<span>&nbsp; </span>Will try and send You a few words, in This new Year.<span>&nbsp; </span>And The first thing I want to wish You, is a good and blessed New Year.<span>&nbsp; </span>The old year has now gone into The unknown Eternity.<span>&nbsp; </span>And everything that encountered us in The old Year, of sorrow as well as joy, is also gone.<span>&nbsp; </span>But we must be ready to, meet the fruit of The seed we&rsquo;ve sown in The Days that have now gone with The old Year.<span>&nbsp; </span>Here in old Norway everything is The same.<span>&nbsp; </span>All through the Winter we&rsquo;ve had horrible weather.<span>&nbsp; </span>Storms after storms for several Months.<span>&nbsp; </span>Yes some places have had Hurricane-like storms.<span>&nbsp; </span>Many ships have been wrecked.<span>&nbsp; </span>And many people have lost their lives.<span>&nbsp; </span>Several houses have blown down everywhere, and cattle has also been Killed.<span>&nbsp; </span>Yes everything indicates that we&rsquo;re approaching the days of tribulation.<span>&nbsp; </span>Just listen to all the disagreements everywhere in the World.<span>&nbsp; </span>Wars and wars again.<span>&nbsp; </span>At the same time as They&rsquo;re talking about peace, and peace conferences, They&rsquo;re selling Weapons and war materials to all parts.<span>&nbsp; </span>Yes.<span>&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;s a fine, but Devilish hypocrisy.<span>&nbsp; </span>Well, well.<span>&nbsp; </span>We&rsquo;ll see how It goes. <span>&nbsp;</span>I&rsquo;ve now finished my work with the Railroad.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;ve now become a pensioner.<span>&nbsp; </span>That means that I get a certain amount every Month, as long as we live both Hanna and I.<span>&nbsp; </span>Hanna is still Unwell.<span>&nbsp; </span>She still has pain.<span>&nbsp; </span>Tomorrow she&rsquo;s going to the Hospital again for treatment.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;m not quite well either.<span>&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;s the Nerves in my chest that aren&rsquo;t quite right. <span>&nbsp;</span>There are others by the way who have The same thing.<span>&nbsp; </span>I guess That&rsquo;s a result of the war too, like all other Misery.<span>&nbsp; </span>We had a letter from Laura yesterday.<span>&nbsp; </span>She says that Mindor has been in the Hospital for a while. He fell down from a ladder, and hurt his Shoulder and Pelvis.<span>&nbsp; </span>Well We&rsquo;ve all got something.<span>&nbsp; </span>Olav Holm is also Unwell.<span>&nbsp; </span>He&rsquo;s about to lose his sight Laura says.<span>&nbsp; </span>Well That&rsquo;s not The best thing to happen.<span>&nbsp; </span>All&rsquo;s well with all our children.<span>&nbsp; </span>They all have their Work, and one should be satisfied with that.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;ve recently had a letter from my sisters in America.<span>&nbsp; </span>Sister Marie is not quite well.<span>&nbsp; </span>She&rsquo;s just had that Operation in the hospital, and It might have been too hard on her.<span>&nbsp; </span>But Getrude and Anna are doing well, though They&rsquo;ve had an unusual summer There too. Cold and miserable.<span>&nbsp; </span>Would you be so kind Alma, as to write a few words to Florense Vinters, and tell her hello from us.<span>&nbsp; </span>We would so much like to write to her too.<span>&nbsp; </span>But as she can&rsquo;t read Norwegian, I&rsquo;d be afraid to try and write in English.<span>&nbsp; </span>It would take me too long.<span>&nbsp; </span>But please give her our regards.<span>&nbsp; </span>Hope You are all well There.<span>&nbsp; </span>Your old Mother is alive I assume, and Doing as usual.<span>&nbsp; </span>Say hello to everybody, and keep well all of you.<span>&nbsp; </span>My wife and children all send You their regards.<span>&nbsp; </span>Karen, Gusta greet You especially.<span>&nbsp; </span>Gusta is getting married now in about 14 days.<span>&nbsp; </span>So now Hanna and I will probably be alone.<span>&nbsp; </span>Her Husband will probably go home soon.<span>&nbsp; </span>He&rsquo;s from the South near Oslo and is a Master Joiner.<span>&nbsp; </span>Well goodbye and warm regards from us all.</p></p>\n<p>Hanna and Edv. Eidum</p></p>\n<p>box 68.<span>&nbsp; </span>Narvik<span>&nbsp; </span>Norway</p></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p></p>"
