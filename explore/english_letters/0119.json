      "<p>How are Alma and her family?<span>&nbsp; </span>Give them our best regards.<span>&nbsp; </span>I have sent a letter to Alma and thanked her for all the packages you&rsquo;ve sent &ndash; has she received it I wonder? &ndash; Yesterday we received a package with ladies clothes from Florece Winters, father&rsquo;s cousin in Chicago.<span>&nbsp; </span>You see we got a letter from her where she says she has sent us 2 or 3 pkgs. and yesterday the first one arrived.<span>&nbsp; </span>There was a dotted dress out of silk in it, aunt Laura got that one &lsquo;cause she only has an old summer dress, she&rsquo;s going to get it altered a little so that it&rsquo;ll fit. 1 blue skirt fit Astrid perfectly and other than that there were different things that we&rsquo;ll take apart and alter or give away.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;m going to write to her and thank her now.</p></p>\n<p>We&rsquo;re starting to get som goods now, but it&rsquo;s so terribly expensive.<span>&nbsp; </span>They had ready made aprons out of small check cotton fabric<span>&nbsp; </span>cost over <span style=–text-decoration: underline;–>40</span> kr so it&rsquo;s outrageous. We have a visit from Laura almost every day<span>&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;s not easy being her either as they have so little to live off of &ndash; but Laura is so cheerful so she manages &ndash; just too bad that she has such awful nerve pains in her head and arthritis.<span>&nbsp; </span>Mindor is out of work &ndash; he&rsquo;s also spoilt &ndash; but doesn&rsquo;t have very good health either and is used to having his mother support him &ndash; <span style=–text-decoration: underline;–>a man of 34 years old!</span><span>&nbsp; </span>Laura&rsquo;s husband was such a heavy drinker you know and spent his earnings on spirits so Laura worked at a factory to get food in the house.<span>&nbsp; </span>Well, such is life.</p></p>\n<p>I see that you have sent tools to father and others and that you&rsquo;re including 2 small knives for me.<span>&nbsp; </span>Well, I&rsquo;ll say thank you so much in advance &ndash; it&rsquo;s fun to get something you make yourself.<span>&nbsp; </span>Say hello to your wife from me and all of us, keep well and think about coming here this summer!</p></p>\n<p>You ask for bank addresses: <span>&nbsp;</span>Stj&oslash;rdal Sparebank, Stj&oslash;rdal, Hegra Sparebank, Hegra.<span>&nbsp; </span>Both are solid and good.</p></p>\n<p>Bestt wishes to you from Herborg.</p></p>"
