      "POSTCARD FROM OLA HOLM TO MRS BERT WILSON, 102 W. 5 ST., DELL RAPIDS, SO. DAK., U.S.A.  IT HAS A PICTURE OF HELL RAILWAY STATION, WHICH IS VERY CLOSE TO STJÃ˜RDAL.  TO THIS DATE THE POSTCARDS FROM HELL WITH A PICTURE OF THE RAILWAY STATION ARE VERY POPULAR AMONG TOURISTS. \r\nTHE STAMP HAS BEEN REMOVED AND IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO READ THE DATE BUT IT MUST BE FAIRLY EARLY IN THE 1900'S.  I'M NOT SURE WHEN BERT DIED."
