      "<p>Well, now it&rsquo;s been a long time since you heard anything from me.<span>&nbsp; </span>First I want to thank you for the letter which Edvart got.<span>&nbsp; </span>What a sad message it had about uncle John already having died<span>&nbsp; </span>I almost can&rsquo;t believe it.<span>&nbsp; </span>And even more sad to know, that Edvart&rsquo;s letter didn&rsquo;t get there in time, poor uncle who had been waiting for a letter from him.<span>&nbsp; </span>I assume his wife is in a bad mood <em>(these are the actual words she uses, but it&rsquo;s just an expression for &ldquo;his wife must be down and unhappy&rdquo;).</em><span>&nbsp; </span>Oh well Alma I suppose you&rsquo;ve also been busy during this time.<span>&nbsp; </span>Just think that uncle didn&rsquo;t get to see his dear Norway again before he passed on.<span>&nbsp; </span>We&rsquo;ve often talked about how nice it would be if all of you could get a chance to come here for Gretha&rsquo;s Confirmation.<span>&nbsp; </span>It looks like it&rsquo;ll be in June, but I guess it will be difficult, as the distance is so infinitely great between us.<span>&nbsp; </span>How are you all otherwise.<span>&nbsp; </span>Hope you&rsquo;re all doing well and are healthy.<span>&nbsp; </span>I spoke with father on the phone a while back.<span>&nbsp; </span>He was about to go to Trondheim.<span>&nbsp; </span>Out here there&rsquo;s frost and a lot of snow.<span>&nbsp; </span>Today it&rsquo;s a little milder and rain.<span>&nbsp; </span>Imagine on the 12<sup>th</sup> of March mother and father can celebrate their Golden anniversary. <span>&nbsp;</span>Johan and I have all along planned to go to Narvik for the 12<sup>th</sup>, but it looks like it wont happen, as all 3 children are in school, and the cow barn needs its care.<span>&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;s so hard to get hold of help.<span>&nbsp; </span>Jan is sitting here drawing now<span>&nbsp; </span>he says mom you must say hello to aunt Alma from me too.<span>&nbsp; </span>Gretha and Edvart are also going to write a few words to you.<span>&nbsp; </span>Johan is reading today&rsquo;s paper, he too asks me to tell you all hello.<span>&nbsp; </span>Well, now I&rsquo;ll let Gretha continue. <span>&nbsp;</span>Keep very well then, and give your old mother my very best regards.<span>&nbsp; </span>Write soon.<span>&nbsp; </span>Say hello to all your children.</p></p>\n<p>Best wishes &Aring;got.</p></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p></p>\n<p>WRITTEN BY GRETHA S&Oslash;BERG ON THE SAME PAPER:</p></p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s been a long time since I wrote to you.<span>&nbsp; </span>I just got back from school a few hours ago.<span>&nbsp; </span>On Monday I&rsquo;m starting home ec&rsquo;s <em>(the word &ldquo;h&aring;ndgjerning&rdquo; is an old term which we used to call classes in knitting, embroidery etc.).</em><span>&nbsp; </span>This summer when I&rsquo;m through with school, I&rsquo;m going to grandma&rsquo;s and granddad&rsquo;s in Narvik.<span>&nbsp; </span>This Christmas I went to a Christmas party for children.<span>&nbsp; </span>It was a lot of fun with that big Santa.<span>&nbsp; </span>Do you have Santas at the parties in America?<span>&nbsp; </span>On Sundays Jan and I go to Sunday School.<span>&nbsp; </span>I hadn&rsquo;t thought that the letter writing between John Holm and us would come to an end so soon.<span>&nbsp; </span>It was such sad news.<span>&nbsp; </span>Please write again soon.</p></p>\n<p>Regards Greta S&oslash;berg.</p></p>\n<p>Jan asks me to tell you hello.</p></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p></p>\n<p>WRITTEN BY EDVART S&Oslash;BERG IN THE SAME LETTER:</p></p>\n<p>Good morning Alma.</p></p>\n<p>I will, send you a few words, to go in mother&rsquo;s letter.<span>&nbsp; </span>I got the letter, which you sent me, and from that I understand that John Holm is dead, and you can&rsquo;t imagine how upset I am that my letter didn&rsquo;t reach him before he died.<span>&nbsp; </span>I hope you understood the letter I wrote to him.<span>&nbsp; </span>You see, I&rsquo;ve only been in middle school for a year and half so you understand I don&rsquo;t know much English.<span>&nbsp; </span>Your letter I understood quite well even though there were some unfamiliar words.</p></p>\n<p>Well I don&rsquo;t have anything else to say, as I assume mother has told you how we&rsquo;re doing, I&rsquo;ll write more another time.</p></p>\n<p>Best wishes Edvart.</p></p>"
