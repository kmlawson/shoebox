      "<p>Dear Brother and everybody.</p></p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ll send you, a few words, so that you&rsquo;ll hear that we&rsquo;re alive.<span>&nbsp; </span>Well now it&rsquo;s spring again, but it&rsquo;s so Cold, that we have to Light the fire in the Stove, so it&rsquo;ll be a late Summer, and the Arthritis is bad in this cold weather, I&rsquo;m so terribly bothered with Arthritis, so I&rsquo;m in bed more than I&rsquo;m up, many days.<span>&nbsp; </span>And Mindor, has been bothered with Bronchitis for a long time, so he can&rsquo;t handle anything, before he has to lye down quite often, he has been with a Farmer for a while, but he had to quit, he couldn&rsquo;t handle it.<span>&nbsp; </span>Yes it&rsquo;s too bad, he&rsquo;s so sickly, we could have been fine the two of us, if he had his health, he&rsquo;s kind and decent, but we&rsquo;re not meant to walk on roses, through life.<span>&nbsp; </span>Like the proverb says, everybody has his own, big, or, small, in Heaven alone, we&rsquo;ll be rid of it all.<span>&nbsp; </span>I heard in Herborg&rsquo;s letter, that you were unwell, yes it could soon be over, for any one of us, the group of Siblings, is getting smaller, one after the other is going, many times one can get Tired, of everything, around us.<span>&nbsp; </span>the best thing would be, to be allowed to move, from here, and be with the Lord.<span>&nbsp; </span>But for Mindor&rsquo;s sake,<span>&nbsp; </span>it&rsquo;s desirable that I, will get to live yet, because he needs me so much.<span>&nbsp; </span>Sister Hanna is 71 years old today, she&rsquo;s unwell, and almost blind, poor thing.<span>&nbsp; </span>I haven&rsquo;t seen her for 34 years.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;d wish, I could visit her, but I can&rsquo;t afford it, so we&rsquo;ll. probably never see eachother again.<span>&nbsp; </span>I wish you all the best, in the time, you have left, whether it be long or short.</p></p>\n<p>A thousand dear wishes from Laura and Mindor.</p></p>\n<p>Say hello to everybody. from us.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;ll soon write to Alma.</p></p>"
