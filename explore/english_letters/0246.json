      "<p>Dear Alma!<span>&nbsp; </span>Well now we&rsquo;re through with the old year, <span>&nbsp;</span>I Want to wish you all a peaceful and blessed year.<span>&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;s three years now since my wife died<span>&nbsp; </span>it was on the 18<sup>th</sup><span>&nbsp; </span>How quickly time rolls on.</p></p>\n<p>Gjertine has died, you probably know that, I, and Olav and wife were there, so now mother is gone there too<span>&nbsp; </span>only memories and yearning left behind.<span>&nbsp; </span>May we all leave a beam of light behind us when we&rsquo;re done here.<span>&nbsp; </span>But when one looks at one&rsquo;s own life, there&rsquo;s mostly darkness, and black spots on the suit that once was nice and clean.<span>&nbsp; </span>Sin stains us.</p></p>\n<p>And now there will soon be work to do in the garden, and one can see life growing and breaking through.<span>&nbsp; </span>We&rsquo;re as usual.<span>&nbsp; </span>Herborg is at home with me.<span>&nbsp; </span>What will happen I don&rsquo;t know, Am still not married <em>(or does he mean Herborg is still not married? The Norwegian language doesn&rsquo;t have &ldquo;am&rdquo;, <span>&nbsp;</span>&ldquo;is&rdquo;, &ldquo;are&rdquo; etc., the same form of the verb is used whether it&rsquo;s she or they or he or I).</em><span>&nbsp; </span>Laura &ndash; Mindor are not too bad.<span>&nbsp; </span>Bad health both of them but managing.<span>&nbsp; </span>She washes some clothes <em>(probably for other people).</em><span>&nbsp; </span>Mindor is a driver now and then for someone here.<span>&nbsp; </span>Eilif &ndash; Arne &ndash; Einar are well and doing fine.<span>&nbsp; </span>Likewise in Narvik.<span>&nbsp; </span>Everybody is starting to get old<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;m the only one who&rsquo;s going strong, and of good cheer. <span>&nbsp;</span>And looking forward with pleasure to spring and a good summer.</p></p>\n<p><em>Then he quotes a line from a song about spring and how leaves are growing etc</em>.</p></p>\n<p><em>Next he quotes a psalm; its meaning is something like:</em></p></p>\n<p>Completely covered in your wounds, from hence your blood was running.</p></p>\n<p>Saved by grace I blissfully stand in the midst of all my distress.</p></p>\n<p>Is this my refuge!</p></p>\n<p>is this your, hiding place.</p></p>\n<p>Then the two of us are, blissful. in the creation of Jesus</p></p>\n<p>Regards Aksel<span>&nbsp; </span>Psalm 50.10</p></p>\n<p>Here comes Laura<span>&nbsp; </span>she sends her regards<br /> <br /></p></p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s raining today and foggy and slippery.<span>&nbsp; </span>nothing but ice</p></p>\n<p>Herborg says hello<span>&nbsp; </span>is sitting here knitting</p></p>"
