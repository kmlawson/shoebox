      "<p>Many thanks for the Card and Handkerchief, it&rsquo;s fun to hear from you, I feel it&rsquo;s been so long since I heard from you.<span>&nbsp; </span>First of all I must write about the, Package you&rsquo;ve sent to Aksel as long ago as this Spring, he, hasn&rsquo;t received any package, and therefore I haven&rsquo;t received the fabric either.<span>&nbsp; </span>Why haven&rsquo;t you, said so in your letters to Aksel, we could have looked into it, at the Post Office or the Customs Office when we&rsquo;re in Town.<span>&nbsp; </span>but as soon as I get to Town I&rsquo;ll check on it anyway<span>&nbsp; </span>it&rsquo;s terribly annoying that we don&rsquo;t get it, you&rsquo;re so kind to send it to us.<span>&nbsp; </span>it&rsquo;s so much fun, and it&rsquo;s so welcome, at the same time I want to ask if you last year for Christmas got. the Handkerchief sent from me, along with a Christmas greeting.<span>&nbsp; </span>so it looks like a lot of the things that are sent across the Ocean get lost <em>(if Laura had stopped to think, she would have realized that&rsquo;s why Alma has sent her some fabric, because Laura mentions in that letter she could sell those handkerchiefs, but she can&rsquo;t get a hold of fabric to make them with).</em><span>&nbsp; </span>We&rsquo;re living as usual, with Sickness, and Mindor almost nothing to do, it&rsquo;s difficult to live in the World, and I&rsquo;ve been Sick a lot this winter, and Mindor too<span>&nbsp; </span>Gjertine died about 14 days ago, Ola has lost his sight on one of his eyes, Otherwise life goes on as usual, Keep real well all of you, please write again sometime, I&rsquo;m so bad at writing therefore I don&rsquo;t do it much either.<span>&nbsp; </span>I must quit, Because of the Paper.<span>&nbsp; </span>I didn&rsquo;t have Air paper. it goes a lot quicker with Airmail.</p></p>\n<p>A thousand dear greetings from Laura and Mindor. <span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p></p>"
