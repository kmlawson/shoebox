You&rsquo;re good at writing Norwegian, I understand your letter very well.<span>&nbsp; </span>You must give my regards to uncle and auntie and also the children.<span>&nbsp; </span>You say that you&rsquo;re going to send something, but that&rsquo;s way too kind I think.<span>&nbsp; </span>Here in Norway there&rsquo;s little or nothing yet and what to put on the wish list is not easy either since one lacks so many things.<span>&nbsp; </span>I have only one pair of shoes that is usable and with regard to dresses I have a skirt and a blouse and a winter dress and that&rsquo;s good because there might be those who have nothing.<span>&nbsp; </span>as far as newer clothes go too.<span>&nbsp; </span>I have 2 house dresses, but I can&rsquo;t wear those outside the house.<span>&nbsp; </span>But we&rsquo;ve become so frugal these 5 years.</p></p>\n<p>The coat I have is an old coat after Father.<span>&nbsp; </span>and then I have a jacket that used to be his suit. So the death of one is the benfit of another <em>(Norwegian saying),</em> isn&rsquo;t that so.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;m out of slips and girdles, but hope we&rsquo;ll be able to get those here too soon.<span>&nbsp; </span>So now You know what one has, but You mustn&rsquo;t think that I expect to get all this because you probably have Norway full of relatives, and if you were to send something to everybody you&rsquo;d go bankrupt.</p></p>\n<p>Well that&rsquo;s life.<span>&nbsp; </span>Hope the times we&rsquo;ll get better little by little now so that we can get what we need.<span>&nbsp; </span>Will write again soon and tell you news from Norway.<span>&nbsp; </span>Hasn&rsquo;t Mother written you.<span>&nbsp; </span>Don&rsquo;t know if she has received any package yet, because haven&rsquo;t heard from her for a few weeks.<span>&nbsp; </span>She&rsquo;s slow to write.</p></p>\n<p>Keep well then all of you.</p></p>\n<p>Best wishes from Anna Folke <em>(her husband, his full name was Karl Folke Sundberg)</em> and Liv<span>&nbsp; </span><em>(Anna later had a boy, Rolf)</em></p></p>\n<p><em>Anna became senile and died a few years ago.</em></p></p>\n<p><em>Solveig became senile and died early this year (2000)</em></p></p>\n<p><em>Jorun is senile and is in a home in Moss, her husband died around 1988.</em></p></p>\n<p><em>Tora died Aug. 1990</em></p></p>\n<p><em>Brage died Jan.1991</em></p></p>\n<p><em>Odd died Oct. 1992.<span>&nbsp; </span>He was married twice: With my mother&Aring;se Torsvik he had me, &Aring;se Siri (Holm) Lawson, and with his second wife Magna he had Conrad Lauritz and Sigrun.</em></p></p>\n<p><em>Svanhild died Jan. 1989</em></p></p>\n<p><em>Don&rsquo;t know if Kari is still alive, I&rsquo;ve never met </em></p></p>"
