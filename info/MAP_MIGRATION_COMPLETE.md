# Map Migration Complete! ✓

## What Was Done

### 1. Backup Created
- **Original map folder backed up to:** `map_backup_20251020/`
- All original files preserved (Google Maps version)

### 2. New Leaflet Files Created

**Updated files:**
- `map/index.html` - Main map showing all locations (2.3 KB)
- `map/getloc.php` - Individual location focus (3.1 KB)

**Unchanged files:**
- `map/locations.csv` - Your location data (preserved)
- `map/createkml.php` - Legacy file (no longer needed but kept)
- `map/places.kml` - Legacy file (no longer needed but kept)

### 3. What Changed

**Old (Google Maps v2):**
- ✗ HTTP URLs (blocked by browsers)
- ✗ Deprecated Google Maps API
- ✗ Required API key
- ✗ Used KML file

**New (Leaflet + OpenStreetMap):**
- ✓ All HTTPS URLs (secure)
- ✓ Modern Leaflet.js library
- ✓ Free, no API key needed
- ✓ Loads directly from CSV
- ✓ Better mobile support
- ✓ Faster loading

## Testing

### Test the standalone maps:

1. **All locations:** `https://huginn.net/shoebox/map/index.html`
   - Should show map of Norway with all location markers
   - Click markers to see location names and descriptions

2. **Single location:** `https://huginn.net/shoebox/map/getloc.php?title=Trondheim&latlong=63.430487,10.395061`
   - Should zoom to Trondheim
   - Show all other locations faintly in background

### Test from main site:

Visit: `https://huginn.net/shoebox/letters/map/`
- The iframe should now load properly
- Clicking location names should focus the map

## If There Are Issues

### Map doesn't load:
- Check browser console (F12) for errors
- Make sure `locations.csv` is accessible
- Verify files uploaded to correct location

### Styling looks wrong:
- Leaflet CSS might be blocked - check browser console
- Make sure HTTPS is working

### Want to revert:
```bash
# Restore original Google Maps version
cp -r map_backup_20251020/* map/
```

## Next Steps (Optional Improvements)

### 1. Update the Omeka page code
You still need to paste the updated code from `NEW_MAP_PAGE_CODE.html` into your Omeka admin panel to take full advantage of Leaflet integration.

### 2. Remove legacy files
Once you confirm everything works, you can delete:
- `map/places.kml` (8.3 KB)
- `map/createkml.php` (2.7 KB)

### 3. Customize the map
You can easily customize:
- Map tiles (satellite, terrain, etc.)
- Marker icons
- Colors and styling
- Zoom levels
- Clustering for nearby locations
