      "<p>Dear Alma and Mother.</p></p>\n<p>Many thanks for the letter which we got today.<span>&nbsp; </span>You are The only one of ours, who remembers us with letters, and who honestly bring up all the things that we&rsquo;ve had no idea about.<span>&nbsp; </span>Oh how I wish Alma, that I&lsquo;d been so close to You, that we could have talked a little bit with each other.<span>&nbsp; </span>We <span style=–text-decoration: underline;–>completely</span> agree with You and Your dear Mother about everything. <span>&nbsp;</span>I cannot fathom that John could act as Foolishly and dumb as he did.<span>&nbsp; </span>He should have known that This wouldn&rsquo;t work. <span>&nbsp;</span>And it&rsquo;s also strange that Axel and Olav have not brought the matter to Your mother&rsquo;s attention, keeping us out of the whole thing, is one thing.<span>&nbsp; </span>But the fact that Your Mother and You have been kept out, That we don&rsquo;t understand.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;ll tell You Alma that Hanna and I have had a letter from Olav where he accuses us of, having been in a secret conference with You There in America.<span>&nbsp; </span>So we shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to write to You nor John during The time he was alive.<span>&nbsp; </span>Even Laura has suspected us of having had full knowledge of everything, through letters from You and John.<span>&nbsp; </span>But dear Alma <span style=–text-decoration: underline;–>do not say anything</span> about This to any of Them.<span>&nbsp; </span>Because You know we&rsquo;ll only get unpleasantness from Them all.<span>&nbsp; </span>The only thing lacking is that we shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to write to You, and at least thank You for all The packages we&rsquo;ve received from You. <span>&nbsp;</span>Hanna is sitting There with great pain in her legs.<span>&nbsp; </span>And she has shed many tears, because her own brothers are misjudging her.<span>&nbsp; </span>When we heard after John&rsquo;s Death, that John had sent money here, and that we too were to get some of It, we were of course glad.<span>&nbsp; </span>But when we later heard, and understood that It was only based on trickery, It hurt us so bad, that we said to each other. <span>&nbsp;</span>If This has been done through trickery only, and without John&rsquo;s wife knowing about it, and then for us to even be suspected of spying on You There, and especially on John himself, Then we&rsquo;d rather be free, and not get any of it, no matter how painful we think That is.<span>&nbsp; </span>And let me say again.<span>&nbsp; </span>I cannot understand, nor have I <span style=–text-decoration: underline;–>ever before</span> understood people with such a disposition.<span>&nbsp; </span>We are thankful to both God and People for everything we get.<span>&nbsp; </span>But if It&rsquo;s not granted us in an honest and good way, we&rsquo;d rather not be considered, and be free.<span>&nbsp; </span>God will find a way for us too, like he has done up until today.<span>&nbsp; </span>Well our dear Alma your old Mother, and all Your loved ones.<span>&nbsp; </span>We hope and believe that none of You think, that We would want to treat You in This way.<span>&nbsp; </span>We&rsquo;re too fond of You all for that.<span>&nbsp; </span>And if I had been close to You, I would have taken You all in my arms.<span>&nbsp; </span>So let God&rsquo;s will come to pass.</p></p>\n<p>We&rsquo;re doing as usual here.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;ve also been on Sick leave since December before Christmas.<span>&nbsp; </span>But hope that I can go back to Work again soon now.<span>&nbsp; </span>The children are all doing well.<span>&nbsp; </span>The one who&rsquo;s having a hard time and for whom It&rsquo;s difficult is Lyder.<span>&nbsp; </span>He works hard, and is not very strong either.<span>&nbsp; </span>I was lucky enough to win kr. 500 in the Lottery 3 months ago.<span>&nbsp; </span>And Hanna got <span style=–text-decoration: underline;–>all</span> of It to Divide between the children.<span>&nbsp; </span>I have greetings for you from Karen.<span>&nbsp; </span>She has gotten <span style=–text-decoration: underline;–>everything</span> You sent, and apologizes for having been so busy that she hasn&rsquo;t replied yet.<span>&nbsp; </span>But now You&rsquo;ll very soon get her heartfelt thanks and reply.<span>&nbsp; </span>Well It&rsquo;s a dangerous time we&rsquo;re living in.<span>&nbsp; </span>But we&rsquo;ll have to hope that America and Russia will also come to an agreement.<span>&nbsp; </span>The war will probably come one day.<span>&nbsp; </span>But not just yet according to the scriptures, as far as I understand it anyway.<span>&nbsp; </span>I haven&rsquo;t heard from Marie for a while.<span>&nbsp; </span>But I had a letter from Bergljot recently.<span>&nbsp; </span>She says that Marie is a little better, and is at home again now. I received Dekoraposten <em>(The Dekorah Post)</em> from Marie.<span>&nbsp; </span>And There I saw John Holm&rsquo;s Death announcement <em>(obituary?).</em><span>&nbsp; </span>A long piece was written about him, and his work.<span>&nbsp; </span>But tell us Alma.<span>&nbsp; </span>Was John not a Widower When he Married Your Mother?<span>&nbsp; </span>It said nothing about That.<span>&nbsp; </span>Say hello to Florence.<span>&nbsp; </span>She&rsquo;ll soon get a letter.<span>&nbsp; </span>You&rsquo;re warmly greeted from all of us in my home.<span>&nbsp; </span>And It hurts me, that You Alma have not been better rewarded for Your work and toil.<span>&nbsp; </span>God bless You, and all Yours, and Your dear old Mother.</p></p>\n<p>A thousand greetings from</p></p>\n<p>Hanna and E. Eidum.</p></p>"
