      "<p>The letters you get from here are few and far between.<span>&nbsp; </span>Don&rsquo;t know if our letters get there.<span>&nbsp; </span>How are you all. Here in Vester&aring;len we&rsquo;re having horrible weather just rain and storms.<span>&nbsp; </span>We&rsquo;ve had a Norwegian-American visitor this summer.<span>&nbsp; </span>He&rsquo;s a good friend of my husband&rsquo;s.<span>&nbsp; </span>He went to America for the first time just before we got married.<span>&nbsp; </span>That is he has been in America for 19 years until now this summer when he came home for a while.<span>&nbsp; </span>Yes it was really nice to see him again after so many years.<span>&nbsp; </span>He lives in Mineapolis.<span>&nbsp; </span>I asked him to look you up and bring you greetings from us, and this he promised.<span>&nbsp; </span>He left here at the end of September, and was to arrive in America around the 12<sup>th</sup> of October, so he should have gotten there by now.<span>&nbsp; </span>Well, now Gretha has ended her schooling and she&rsquo;s now at home helping me so now I have great help in her.<span>&nbsp; </span>We&rsquo;ve now gotten our crops indoors and are done with the hard work of summer.<span>&nbsp; </span>We got very little hay, so we had to sell lots of animals 2 cows 9 sheep 2 calves, so now there&rsquo;s little work in the barn. <span>&nbsp;</span>I spoke with father on the phone yesterday and he said that he was going to Trondheim.<span>&nbsp; </span>Edvart has also gone south all the way down to Halden.<span>&nbsp; </span>He&rsquo;s gone to work. <span>&nbsp;</span>I&rsquo;m going to cook sour cream porridge tonight <em>(a traditional meal).</em><span>&nbsp; </span>Gretha says that you must take a trip across the Atlantic and come and eat with us tonight.<span>&nbsp; </span>It looks pretty dark in the world today.<span>&nbsp; </span>Everything points to war again.<span>&nbsp; </span>If we have another war now, it&rsquo;ll probably be the last.<span>&nbsp; </span>How&rsquo;s your mother?<span>&nbsp; </span>is she doing ok?<span>&nbsp; </span>I suppose it got very lonely for her when uncle John passed away.<span>&nbsp; </span>Do you have your children at home, or are they gone some place. I can&rsquo;t think of anything else to write about just now.<span>&nbsp; </span>Keep well and write a few words soon.</p></p>\n<p>Best wishes to you all in the family from all of us here at home.</p></p>\n<p>&Aring;goth</p></p>\n<p>Veggemo 17-10-48</p></p>"
