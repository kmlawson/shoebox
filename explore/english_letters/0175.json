      "<p>Thank you for your last letter.<span>&nbsp; </span>I should have written a long time ago, but first I was on vacation a while, and since we&rsquo;ve started work again there&rsquo;s constantly been something.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;ve written to Alma and Grace with greetngs to you and auntie, so I hope you&rsquo;ve gotten it.</p></p>\n<p>How are you all?<span>&nbsp; </span>Everything is as usual here.<span>&nbsp; </span>Father is complaining of arthritis here and there now, mostly it&rsquo;s his head that&rsquo;s bothering him.<span>&nbsp; </span>Mother is also bothered with arthritis.<span>&nbsp; </span>I guess it goes with old age.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;m now struggling to collect equipment <em>(meaning items for her home after she&rsquo;s married)</em>, and little by little I&rsquo;m getting there.<span>&nbsp; </span>We can&rsquo;t expect to have everything perfect from the beginning.<span>&nbsp; </span>We&rsquo;re house hunting now.<span>&nbsp; </span>We can&rsquo;t live at home, as Agnes lives at home, and she has two boys.</p></p>\n<p>The last letter I got from Alma was one she had written in May.<span>&nbsp; </span>She writes that she has just found it and forgotten to send it.<span>&nbsp; </span>But I&rsquo;ve actually received the same letter before, it was even the first one I got from her.<span>&nbsp; </span>She writes that she hasn&rsquo;t had a reply to it, but I have written.</p></p>\n<p>Aunt Laura was here for a visit recently, she told us about her Narvik trip.<span>&nbsp; </span>She&rsquo;d had such a nice time.<span>&nbsp; </span>Too bad aunt Helga&rsquo;s eyesight is so bad, she&rsquo;s almost blind now <em>(she keeps calling her Helga instead of Hanna, Helga was Axel&rsquo;s wife).</em></p></p>\n<p>I hear Alma turns 60 years old on November 15.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;ve ordered a wowen table runner which we&rsquo;re planning to send her.<span>&nbsp; </span>Hope it gets finished.<span>&nbsp; </span>I guess you don&rsquo;t make things like that in America.<span>&nbsp; </span>Effi my youngest sister lives in Oslo now<span>&nbsp; </span>she rents a room there, and likes it very much.</p></p>\n<p>It has started to get miserable and cold here, and I guess that&rsquo;s only to be expected here in the cold north.<span>&nbsp; </span>But it&rsquo;s wonderful to have a little snow and a long wonderful walk on skis.<span>&nbsp; </span>Is there any snow where you live?<span>&nbsp; </span>You must say hello to auntie from mother and father and everyone here, likewise to Alma and everyone there.<span>&nbsp; </span>It would be fun if we all could meet some day.<span>&nbsp; </span>Father has often talked about a trip to America, but now he&rsquo;s too old.<span>&nbsp; </span>He liked it so much over there.</p></p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ll soon write to Alma again.</p></p>\n<p>Best wishes Evelyn!</p></p>"
