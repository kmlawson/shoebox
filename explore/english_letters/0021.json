      "THIS IS A NORWEGIAN SONG. IT LOOKS LIKE ALMA'S HANDWRITING.  \n\nThis song is about the pretty girl Amanda who wears flowers in her hair, waiting in the park for Herman who never turns up.  Then she sees him with another.  He's just about to tell her he no longer loves her, he loves Ellen, when Alma seems to run out of memory on this song."
