      "<p>Excuse me for writing in pencil, as I have no Ink here <em>(we have to remember, they didn&rsquo;t have ball point pens yet in those days, they still used ink, if I remember correctly.<span>&nbsp; </span>We still used ink wells when I started school in 1955).</em><span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;m now on a trip way up North, far North of &ldquo;Narvik&rdquo;<span>&nbsp; </span>will visit Sis. Hanna on the way back.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;m now staying up in a Narrow dark Valley with sparkling high mountains<span>&nbsp; </span>not exactly prairie land in other words, and here and there a few people are living, in solitude away from all the hustle and bustle of the world, <span>&nbsp;</span>Yesterday I visited a few Lapplanders <span>&nbsp;</span>they like to hear about how, others are doing out in the World<span>&nbsp; </span>poor them, but perhaps they&rsquo;re better satisfied than the Millionaires in the U.S. <span>&nbsp;</span>Yes where the &ldquo;Goat?&rdquo; is born it thrives the best<em> (can&rsquo;t read the word that I think might be &ldquo;goat&rdquo;, <span>&nbsp;</span>possibly an old saying)</em>.<span>&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;s constantly raining here so it&rsquo;s miserable.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;m planning on visiting various towns on the way back, as this will probably be my last long trip, in this life.<span>&nbsp; </span>I hope you and yours are doing well.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;m not quite well myself, but we must be satisfied, as we&rsquo;re subjected to, both good and evil then<span>&nbsp; </span>They&rsquo;re in the middle of Haymaking here<span>&nbsp; </span>gathering grass for the few Cows they own, as the winter is Dark and long, but the summer is bright, it&rsquo;s still almost full daylight here.<span>&nbsp; </span>Next summer, you must come here, then we&rsquo;ll take the trip together.</p></p>\n<p>I hear nothing from Halvor, nor from Florens, everybody is busy with his own things.</p></p>\n<p>I must quit this little note, just a little greeting from this desolate place, one of the World&rsquo;s out-of-the-way places.</p></p>\n<p>Say hello to everyone from me.</p></p>\n<p>Brother Olav</p></p>"
