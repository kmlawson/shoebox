      "<p>Dear Brother and everyone</p></p>\n<p>First I want to thank you, so many times for, the welcome Money, I&rsquo;ve received from you, from Axel, it comes in useful, because Mindor doesn&rsquo;t have any steady Work, besides he&rsquo;s been Sick again for a while, so it&rsquo;s not so easy, but we make it one day at a time, I wanted so much, to take that Money, and go to Narvik but I felt, I had to buy Firewood for it, so that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve done.<span>&nbsp; </span>But I haven&rsquo;t seen Sister Hanna, since, they moved to Narvik. and that must be about 34 years ago now, you wouldn&rsquo;t think, that we lived in the same Country, but Edevart is here, often and many of the Children too.</p></p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m so terribly bothered with Arthritis, and even worse with Headaches.<span>&nbsp; </span>At Aksel&rsquo;s everything is fine, they&rsquo;re lucky, and are well and, have enough to do at all times.<span>&nbsp; </span>Herborg is in Sweden, for 2 weeks, on Vacation now, and Aksel is so good at taking care of himself, we&rsquo;ve had some warm days this Summer, but now it&rsquo;s miserable again.<span>&nbsp; </span>How is it with you and your health, maybe you&rsquo;re better again, so that you can take a trip to Norway, yes a lot of things happen, which we haven&rsquo;t planned on.<span>&nbsp; </span>Say hello to your wife, and Almas<span>&nbsp; </span>all of our kin whom you meet.</p></p>\n<p>Keep very well all of you</p></p>\n<p>A thousand dear greetings from us all.</p></p>\n<p>Mindor. and. Laura.<span>&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;</span></p></p>"
