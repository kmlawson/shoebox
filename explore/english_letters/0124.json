      "<p>Many thanks for yet another letter, boy you are really cookin&rsquo; with your writing now.<span>&nbsp; </span>I see you write about there being few letters, but to tell the truth I write you and answer as soon as I&rsquo;ve received &ldquo;Packages&rdquo;, or a letter, and that&rsquo;s also the least we should do.<span>&nbsp; </span>I usually write the day after I&rsquo;ve received something, but I know it&rsquo;s part of the Norwegian jog trot, this business of writing, people are too lazy here<span>&nbsp; </span>they expect from others, but don&rsquo;t think about doing anything themselves.<span>&nbsp; </span>I see you&rsquo;ve sent a Package again, yes you are priceless, imagine the sport and excitement around these &ldquo;packages&rdquo;.<span>&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;s so sad that I can&rsquo;t repay you in any way, but I really am extremely grateful for whatever we get.<span>&nbsp; </span>I don&rsquo;t know how we could have managed without what we have gotten, and here everything is so expensive too.<span>&nbsp; </span>There&rsquo;s nothing to be found in my trade<span>&nbsp; </span>Electrical things like Plugs, and switches.<span>&nbsp; </span>But someday we&rsquo;re bound to get something.</p></p>\n<p>We have prospects for a good year of &ldquo;harvest&rdquo; here.<span>&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;s not very warm but plenty rain, so it&rsquo;s looking good, and it&rsquo;s needed.<span>&nbsp; </span>I hope things are still good with you, as they are with us.</p></p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m sending this little letter now <span>&nbsp;</span>just to let you see that I received your last one.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thank you in advance for the sent &rdquo;Package&rdquo;, hope it gets here, and I&rsquo;m really looking foreward to it because it&rsquo;s so exciting to see.<span>&nbsp; </span>Hope things are good With Alma, and all of hers.<span>&nbsp; </span>Give her my best regards.</p></p>\n<p>Will end this for now again too, will write again soon.</p></p>\n<p>Best wishes to the wife and you all from all of us</p></p>\n<p>Olav</p></p>\n<p>Nonnegt. 4</p></p>\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p></p>"
