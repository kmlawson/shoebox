      "<p>What joy and surpirse, to get your &ldquo;letter&rdquo; and &ldquo;check&rdquo;<span>&nbsp; </span>I was so down and miserable that morning before it arrived, but the greater the need the nearer the help.<span>&nbsp; </span>I don&rsquo;t know how to thank you, but will say the same as so many do, God bless you John, for your kindness, and I hope you&rsquo;ll have a lot of happiness and luck on your side in return for not closing your heart to someone who needs a helping hand.<span>&nbsp; </span>I want to pay you interest on this money, and put it in an account in your name, and I&rsquo;ll get the Bank to send you receipts for the interest per year like any other loan.<span>&nbsp; </span>I have now rented a small room and am getting ready to settle myself in, but there are several things that are needed and everything is so expensive here, but it will work out.<span>&nbsp; </span>You can be sure I&rsquo;ll do what I can to get something out of it.</p></p>\n<p>My regards also from the wife who says that if she had known there was money on the way, she wouldn&rsquo;t have written that last letter to you, but now it&rsquo;s too late<span>&nbsp; </span>she apologizes, for one should never have anything to do with women.</p></p>\n<p>Well we have received a lot of reading materials, that&rsquo;s interesting to get, it&rsquo;s like a breath from another world, and I so much enjoy reading English so that I wont forget the language.</p></p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s no news here, everything is fine with our folk.<span>&nbsp; </span>We&rsquo;ve had a very fine winter this year.<span>&nbsp; </span>Will end this for now, saying thank you very very much for the time being.<span>&nbsp; </span>The money hasn&rsquo;t arrived yet, but will probably be here in the next few days.<span>&nbsp; </span>My wife sends her best regards, and all the girls, and myself.</p></p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ll write again soon.</p></p>\n<p>Most Brotherly</p></p>\n<p>Olav</p></p>\n<p>Rosenborgstgt. 14</p></p>\n<p>Tr.hjem</p></p>"
