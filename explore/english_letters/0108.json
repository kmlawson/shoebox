      "<p>Thank you for your letter and Christmas greetings.<span>&nbsp; </span>And thank you for the year that has passed.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We wish you good luck with The new Year.<span>&nbsp; </span>And that God&rsquo;s rich blessings will more than ever before, fill our hearts as well as our hearts and home.<span>&nbsp; </span>We&rsquo;re as usual.<span>&nbsp; </span>Hanna my wife has come home again now.<span>&nbsp; </span>She&rsquo;s fairly well.<span>&nbsp; </span>She walks by herself without a Stick, but has some pain in her legs.<span>&nbsp; </span>And no wonder.<span>&nbsp; </span>As for the rest we take one Day at a time.<span>&nbsp; </span>We hope that the goods will start arriving in the stores again, so that we can buy different things.<span>&nbsp; </span>See that you too have been sick.<span>&nbsp; </span>But good that You&rsquo;re well again.<span>&nbsp; </span>Your wife has also been sick.<span>&nbsp; </span>That&rsquo;s how it goes.<span>&nbsp; </span>But the bible says that all things benefit Those, who love God.<span>&nbsp; </span>So all we can do, is thank God for everything.<span>&nbsp; </span>Jesus was tested in everything same as us, Though without sin.<span>&nbsp; </span>Let us learn from him, and not complain.<span>&nbsp; </span>Have recently received a letter from Your brother Axel.<span>&nbsp; </span>He&rsquo;s doing fine.<span>&nbsp; </span>But his wife Helga is sick.<span>&nbsp; </span>She&rsquo;s in a hospital in Hegra, and has Tuberculosis and Diabetes.<span>&nbsp; </span>Looks like she&rsquo;ll get to move home to our father in Heaven soon.<span>&nbsp; </span>Your brother Olav is fine.<span>&nbsp; </span>There are a lot of changes up in Hegra here lately.<span>&nbsp; </span>All the old people are dead on every Farm.<span>&nbsp; </span>But the large Balsatree which stood in Your parents&rsquo; garden is still there, waiting for you to come and visit it once again.<span>&nbsp; </span>You&rsquo;re lucky to have Alma Wilson so close.<span>&nbsp; </span>She seems to be a clever and kind Lady.<span>&nbsp; </span>If I had been as close to her as I am far away from her, I would have thanked her for being so kind and helpful.<span>&nbsp; </span>But the reward will come one day.<span>&nbsp; </span>Hanna is wondering how old brother Johan is now.<span>&nbsp; </span>Aren&rsquo;t you about 75 or 77 years old now?<span>&nbsp; </span>Hanna is 69 or will turn 70 this May if she gets to live.<span>&nbsp; </span>We have now been in Narvik for almost 33 years.<span>&nbsp; </span>All our 10 children are living and all are healthy.<span>&nbsp; </span>Imagine us coming through This war so well.<span>&nbsp; </span>A great miracle of God.<span>&nbsp; </span>We could have Died among bombs and Grenades.<span>&nbsp; </span>But praise be to the lord.<span>&nbsp; </span>Not a sparrow falls to the Ground without the will of our heavenly father.<span>&nbsp; </span>And that we have seen.<span>&nbsp; </span>As soon as we can we&rsquo;ll send You some pictures.<span>&nbsp; </span>But we can&rsquo;t get anything yet.<span>&nbsp; </span>Wishing You all the best.<span>&nbsp; </span>May we all in The new Year put aside all that which prevents us from living each day as if it were our last, Then one day, when God calls us in to rest we&rsquo;ll receive the grace to close our eyes in childish faith and say Father, I leave my Spirit in Your hands.<span>&nbsp; </span>So keep well all of you.<span>&nbsp; </span>Everybody here asks me to greet You.<span>&nbsp; </span>Hanna asks me to greet her dear brother.<span>&nbsp; </span>We have also received letters from my Sisters There in America.<span>&nbsp; </span>They are all doing fine.<span>&nbsp; </span>Bergljot and her Husband have both received God and are well.<span>&nbsp; </span>Sister Marie also prays to God.<span>&nbsp; </span>Yes that is the road.<span>&nbsp; </span>God bless Them all.</p></p>\n<p>With this a loving greeting to You all, and don&rsquo;t forget Alma.<span>&nbsp; </span>Good night.</p></p>\n<p>Hanna and E. Eidum.</p></p>"
