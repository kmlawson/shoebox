      "<p>Dear Brother and Wife.</p></p>\n<p>It has been a long time since, we wrote and we have endured many things since.<span>&nbsp; </span>And we are very thankful and glad that, the War is really over, it&rsquo;s almost impossible to believe. but we&rsquo;ve had a terribly hard time too.<span>&nbsp; </span>But now it is, a little better as far as food lately, but as far as clothes and other things we need it&rsquo;s hopeless, as for me I have neither shoes nor stockings, nor many other things.<span>&nbsp; </span>And my last husband died 3 years ago, and I myself am so bothered with Arthritis, that I can&rsquo;t go out and work, I&rsquo;ll be 62 years old on the 29<sup>th</sup> and at that age you&rsquo;re not fit to work for others And Mindor has been Sick for almost a Year, and is still without work.<span>&nbsp; </span>he has had Water in his Lung, and it&rsquo;s so long-lasting. so it doesn&rsquo;t look very bright for us, but I guess we&rsquo;ll manage.<span>&nbsp; </span>I have now, moved to Stj&oslash;rdal. for good, I wanted to be where my kin is, you get to where you long for them and where you come from.<span>&nbsp; </span>Aksel&rsquo;s are doing very well. but sad that Helga is Sick, yes she, probably wont come home again, she&rsquo;s at a Home in Hegra.<span>&nbsp; </span>she has Tuberculosis<span>&nbsp; </span>Axel had, a very trying time for a while, his 3 Sons, have been gone but have now come home alive, the Oldest has been to all the Prison camps, here, and lastly in Germany.<span>&nbsp; </span>Ola is doing fine.<span>&nbsp; </span>all his daughters are grown up, and very clever nice Ladies, 3 are married and are doing very well.<span>&nbsp; </span>Konrad&rsquo;s as well. At Sister Hanna&rsquo;s, also well. she has been very, Sick, and is almost Blind.<span>&nbsp; </span>Edevart has been here recently, he&rsquo;s Fine.<span>&nbsp; </span>two of her Sons, are living here at Stj&oslash;rdal.<span>&nbsp; </span>So it looks like I&rsquo;m the one, among us all who has been the most, unlucky in life, but not everyone can be lucky, if only Mindor could get well and get, a job, but we&rsquo;ll have to hope for the, best.<span>&nbsp; </span>How are you, I have thought about you many times, in Americ</p></p>\n<p>a these years, when we haven&rsquo;t been in touch with eachother.<span>&nbsp; </span>Do you know anything about Sister Anna&rsquo;s people.<span>&nbsp; </span>I have also written to Alma Kristine today.<span>&nbsp; </span>Please write to me sometime.<span>&nbsp; </span>it&rsquo;s nice to hear how you are.<span>&nbsp; </span>You must come here too, and stay here.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;ll have to close now, in the hope that I&rsquo;ll soon get a letter from you, so that I&rsquo;ll hear how you are<span>&nbsp; </span>say hello to all our kin that you meet.<span>&nbsp; </span>Live very well.</p></p>\n<p>A thousand loving greetings from Sister Laura Karlson</p></p>\n<p>Stj&oslash;rdal</p></p>\n<p>and Mindor</p></p>"
