      "<p>Dear Brother in law and all of Yours.</p></p>\n<p>This evening I&rsquo;d like to send You a few words, so that You&rsquo;ll see that we&rsquo;re alive and operating as usual.<span>&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;s big and good that we get to be healthy every day, and keep up with the battling and struggling of our time.<span>&nbsp; </span>That&rsquo;s Grace on top of Grace.<span>&nbsp; </span>Hanna is the same.<span>&nbsp; </span>With regard to her health that is.<span>&nbsp; </span>But one thing we also know with regard to Hanna and her pains and suffering. That nothing happens to a Human being without It serving for the good.<span>&nbsp; </span>We all have a few Bad edges(?), which must be polished off.<span>&nbsp; </span>And Then we can be sure that everything serves us for the best.<span>&nbsp; </span>If only we could learn to receive everything with gratitude.<span>&nbsp; </span>Well now Summer is over for this year again.<span>&nbsp; </span>We&rsquo;ve actually had a lot of rain this summer, and little Sunshine.<span>&nbsp; </span>But That too is for our own good, and Therefore we ought to give thanks for That also.<span>&nbsp; </span>We&rsquo;ve had a lot of visitors this Summer.<span>&nbsp; </span>I think there have been about 15 to 16 strangers <em>(meaning visitors)</em> here with us.<span>&nbsp; </span>Among them Your and Hanna&rsquo;s siblings Olav Holm and Laura.<span>&nbsp; </span>Olav was here for 5 Days and Laura for 8 Days.<span>&nbsp; </span>Hanna hadn&rsquo;t seen Them for 30 Years.<span>&nbsp; </span>So it was a bit srange for all of Them.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;ve also travelled a lot this summer.<span>&nbsp; </span>Here at home in Norway as well as in Sweden.<span>&nbsp; </span>But now I&rsquo;ve taken up work again.<span>&nbsp; </span>Time flies quickly away from us.<span>&nbsp; </span>I feel it wasn&rsquo;t long ago that I was a little Boy, at home among my siblings father and Mother.<span>&nbsp; </span>And now I&rsquo;m already an old Man.<span>&nbsp; </span>The road of life has been both heavy and light.<span>&nbsp; </span>Partly walking with tears and Partly smiles on the way.<span>&nbsp; </span>But in spite of it all I must say that I&rsquo;ve noticed that God has been true to his promise, and has kept and upheld me until today.<span>&nbsp; </span>There&rsquo;s still a lot of unrest and disagreement in the World.<span>&nbsp; </span>I wonder if The last and great war is closer to us than we think.<span>&nbsp; </span>Yes the signs are already starting to appear.<span>&nbsp; </span>Knowledge will be great in Those last days, and Love will be cold in most It says in God&rsquo;s word.<span>&nbsp; </span>And do we not have These signs now? <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>How are You now?<span>&nbsp; </span>Are You quite well?<span>&nbsp; </span>What about your wife.<span>&nbsp; </span>Is she fairly well?<span>&nbsp; </span>I hear from Alma Wilson that she&rsquo;s at Your home a lot, helping You.<span>&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;s beautiful and good of Alma that she can find the time to visit You.<span>&nbsp; </span>I would very much like, to talk to Alma a little.<span>&nbsp; </span>She&rsquo;s a Person with a sensitive and living heart, for everything that goes with the Blessed Work, that the lord has put his Blessing to.<span>&nbsp; </span>That&rsquo;s a greater and far richer Treasure to own, than all the riches in the world.<span>&nbsp; </span>Though many a time There&rsquo;s very little of all kinds of things, There will always be a way, as long as we believe.<span>&nbsp; </span>Well my dear Brother in law.<span>&nbsp; </span>Keep well again.<span>&nbsp; </span>Say hello to your wife and Alma.<span>&nbsp; </span>Hanna and everyone here in our home send their regards.<span>&nbsp; </span>Will write a little again in a while.<span>&nbsp; </span>Ask Alma if she would send a few words, as a greeting from us to Florense Winters.</p></p>\n<p>Keep well all of you in the Name of Jesus.</p></p>\n<p>Hanna and E. Eidum</p></p>\n<p><span><br /></span></p></p>"
