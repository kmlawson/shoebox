      "<p>Today I received a letter from Alma Wilson, in which I see that You all are living and doing well.<span>&nbsp; </span>We are also doing as usual.<span>&nbsp; </span>Hanna is fairly well after what she has Gone through.<span>&nbsp; </span>Please say hello to Alma, and tell her that she&rsquo;ll soon get a warm letter from me.<span>&nbsp; </span>She can go ahead and send That Ring she mentions<span>&nbsp; </span>Sverre will fix It for her.<span>&nbsp; </span>Alma is asking if we&rsquo;ve received the packages that You&rsquo;ve sent us.<span>&nbsp; </span>And if any of the packages have been opened on the Way.<span>&nbsp; </span>I understand now, that some of my letters that I have sent You have gotten lost.<span>&nbsp; </span>For every one of the packages we have received, I&rsquo;ve sent You a letter.<span>&nbsp; </span>And I&rsquo;ve written up everything the packages contained.<span>&nbsp; </span>Yes, we&rsquo;ve received the Knives and everything You&rsquo;ve sent.<span>&nbsp; </span>Shoes and clothes of different kinds.<span>&nbsp; </span>No package has been opened on the Way.<span>&nbsp; </span>Everything has gotten here.<span>&nbsp; </span>Like I said I&rsquo;ve written about everything, and let us yet again tell You many thanks for everything.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;ve never paid any Customs, for anything.<span>&nbsp; </span>Tell Alma that she can send the Ring in a Registered letter, and send It as an insured letter for about 8 or 10 Dollars.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then It&rsquo;ll be fine.<span>&nbsp; </span>We have nothing in our home from Hanna&rsquo;s parents.<span>&nbsp; </span>Everything was taken by Konrad, Olav and possibly Aksel.<span>&nbsp; </span>You probably remember that You gave Your father a Gold watch and Your Mother got a Ring.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Watch our son Olaf was supposed to get after him Your father said.<span>&nbsp; </span>Because Olaf was named for him.<span>&nbsp; </span>And the Ring our Daughter Karen was supposed to have because she was named for Karen&rsquo;s grandmother.<span>&nbsp; </span>But When Your parents had died, They got nothing. <span>&nbsp;</span>I think Olav has both the Watch and the ring.<span>&nbsp; </span>And everything else of movables probably went the same way.<span>&nbsp; </span>Olav and The others probably know where The Things that were left behind by Your parents When They Died from us went.<span>&nbsp; </span>But Hanna has nothing from her dear parents.<span>&nbsp; </span>I think It&rsquo;s too much to accept everything we&rsquo;ve gotten from You for nothing.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;ll tell You my dear Brother in law that You have sacrificed a lot on us.<span>&nbsp; </span>It costs You a lot of money That&rsquo;s for sure.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thank you so much for everything and God bless you abundantly in return.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Knives we&rsquo;re using every day, and the clothes too.<span>&nbsp; </span>Yes time passes.<span>&nbsp; </span>And soon both I and You will meet our dear old parents again.<span>&nbsp; </span>I see you&rsquo;ve gotten some Newspapers from me.<span>&nbsp; </span>Hope You find something to read.<span>&nbsp; </span>Just think if I had had the opportunity to visit You There in Amerika.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then you probably would have taken Your Auto and driven me around The area.<span>&nbsp; </span>We still haven&rsquo;t gotten any Merchandise to town to speak of.<span>&nbsp; </span>We&rsquo;re waiting for a few things to arrive, like Cups Knives and various other things.<span>&nbsp; </span>I still haven&rsquo;t gotten my Photos, which I ordered half a year ago.<span>&nbsp; </span>Well dear Holm.<span>&nbsp; </span>You must keep well again.<span>&nbsp; </span>Greet all Your loved ones from us.<span>&nbsp; </span>And we&rsquo;ll soon write more.<span>&nbsp; </span>If God wants us to live maybe You&rsquo;ll still come and visit us sometime.<span>&nbsp; </span>Aksel and Laura are fine.<span>&nbsp; </span>Likewise Olav Your brother.<span>&nbsp; </span>But Helga Aksel&rsquo;s wife is apparently very weak.<span>&nbsp; </span>Will write more later.<span>&nbsp; </span>Let us each day remember eachother in prayer.<span>&nbsp; </span>You are greeted warmly from us all.</p></p>\n<p>Greetings with the Psalm 91,</p></p>\n<p>from Yours Hanna and E. Eidum, Post box 68<span>&nbsp; </span>Narvik Norway</p></p>"
