      "<p>Hello brother in law John Holm.</p></p>\n<p>Thank you for the letter which came, while I was away on vacation.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;ve just now come home and will send a few words right away.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;ve been to Stj&oslash;rdal and Hegra for a while.<span>&nbsp; </span>Got to visit all of ours There, my relatives as well as Hanna&rsquo;s.<span>&nbsp; </span>Have greetings from Aksel and all his children.<span>&nbsp; </span>Everything was just fine with all of Them.<span>&nbsp; </span>We drove up to Hegra one day too, and Then Laura Your sister came with us.</p></p>\n<p>When I came home from That trip I went to Vester&aring;len to visit Aagodt.<span>&nbsp; </span>All was well There too.<span>&nbsp; </span>They said to tell You all hello.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Money You sent Gusta I took care of.<span>&nbsp; </span>I got It sold right away, and Gusta got the money.<span>&nbsp; </span>I asked Herborg if she wanted me to help her get Hers exchanged too.<span>&nbsp; </span>But she said she was going to try in Sweden.<span>&nbsp; </span>Oh no.<span>&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;s no problem getting Them exchanged.<span>&nbsp; </span>We had a letter from Alma a few days ago.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;ll reply to That too now.<span>&nbsp; </span>We see that You&rsquo;ve been Unwell for a while, and that You&rsquo;re better again.<span>&nbsp; </span>Yes that&rsquo;s how it goes.<span>&nbsp; </span>Life of man is like the flower in the Field.<span>&nbsp; </span>And nobody knows how long the road is.<span>&nbsp; </span>But one thing we know and That is that the hour will come sometime and rest will be at the door.<span>&nbsp; </span>When we get as far in our life&rsquo;s course that we reach the last free city? <em>(directly translated from &ldquo;fristad&rdquo;, no idea how to say it in English)</em> which we can read about in Joshua&rsquo;s(?) book chapter 20.<span>&nbsp; </span>The worker will be called to rest when his work day is done. <span>&nbsp;</span>Happy Then The soul who can exchange his Sword for the Palm.<span>&nbsp; </span>Well we&rsquo;ve had a fine Summer here.<span>&nbsp; </span>But now autumn is quickly approaching again.<span>&nbsp; </span>We&rsquo;ve had a lot of people visiting this Summer.<span>&nbsp; </span>Hanna&rsquo;s legs are still bothering her.<span>&nbsp; </span>She had x-rays done 2 Days ago.<span>&nbsp; </span>May have to have another Operation.</p></p>\n<p>I would have liked to have quit and become a Pensioner now.<span>&nbsp; </span>But since everything is still so Expensive it may be good to keep at it as long as I can. I can still stay another 2 Years, if I get to live and be healthy.<span>&nbsp; </span>But then I&rsquo;ll have to go, whether I want to or not.</p></p>\n<p>I can greet you from Your brother Olav.<span>&nbsp; </span>I met him too in Trondheim.<span>&nbsp; </span>He was a little better now he said.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;m sending you a couple of pictures from my Work place <em>(these might be the ones that I found in his letter to Alma, dated the same day)</em>.<span>&nbsp; </span>If Hanna had been well I would have taken a trip across the Atlantic this summer.<span>&nbsp; </span>I could have gotten passage on one of the Ore ships that go to America.<span>&nbsp; </span>That&rsquo;s also very cheap.<span>&nbsp; </span>But as Hanna has such trouble walking I don&rsquo;t want to leave her.</p></p>\n<p>Keep well again then.<span>&nbsp; </span>Give our regards to your wife, and all the rest.<span>&nbsp; </span>Hope You&rsquo;re better now.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;d be very interested in coming to visit you, but like I said It probably wont happen now.</p></p>\n<p>Best wishes and good Night</p></p>\n<p>E. Eidum</p></p>"
