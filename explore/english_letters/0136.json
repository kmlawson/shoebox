      "<p>Dear Brother mrs, and Alma and all</p></p>\n<p>Thank you so much for two letters, from you John. and a Package I received yesterday, with Overalls for Mindor and 2 pairs of stockings. and ties and 2 pieces Soap. and Fabric for 6 large Towels.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;ll say a Thousand thanks for everything, it&rsquo;s so dear and welcome.<span>&nbsp; </span>But the Paper was so small, that what was in the Package, was about to fall out.<span>&nbsp; </span>We&rsquo;re living as usual all of us, Mindor isn&rsquo;t quite well so he doesn&rsquo;t have any permanent work. but we&rsquo;ve managed each day, so must be satisfied with that.<span>&nbsp; </span>I do some Knitting and Crocheting, so get some money for that, it&rsquo;s not for sure how long we&rsquo;ll be needing anything either, there will probably be another War again soon. and that&rsquo;ll be the end. of us all, so we don&rsquo;t have anything to look forward to.<span>&nbsp; </span>We&rsquo;re starting to see Fall, and winter, but I guess we&rsquo;ll manage that too.<span>&nbsp; </span>At Aksel&rsquo;s things are as usual.<span>&nbsp; </span>Herborg wrote to you and sent photographs.<span>&nbsp; </span>You wrote, if there&rsquo;s anything I wish for, I must say so, but I don&rsquo;t like to beg. but Mindor asks me, if you could send a Used little Radio, as you may know, all of us had to. Turn our Aparatuses in during the War. and only few have gotten theirs back. and we&rsquo;re one of the unlucky ones who haven&rsquo;t gotten ours. but this can&rsquo;t be done I understand. <span>&nbsp;</span>And I beg you, you mustn&rsquo;t think badly of me, for asking. Because we can&rsquo;t afford to buy, and then it was Razor blades, because they were so good.<span>&nbsp; </span>At Ola&rsquo;s everything is also, as usual.<span>&nbsp; </span>Odd Holm is still at home, but he wants to go to Sea again. he doesn&rsquo;t like it (&ldquo;<em>in&rdquo; missing</em>) Hegra, well you can&rsquo;t blame him.</p></p>\n<p>Thank you very much Alma for your letter, a while back. <span>&nbsp;</span>I ask every time I&rsquo;m in Town if, the National costumes have arrived but it&rsquo;s still difficult.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;ve been to the Woods to Pick Cranberries, which I&rsquo;m Cooking today, there&rsquo;s hardly any Sugar but it&rsquo;ll keep without.<span>&nbsp; </span>Is that to be found in America.<span>&nbsp; </span>Ole&rsquo;s Evelyn said to tell you she had written to your Daughter Greis. but has had no reply. <span>&nbsp;</span>I was to ask her to write, but she can&rsquo;t write Norwegian can she, so then it ends up being your job.<span>&nbsp; </span>I hope that youre getting our letters, where I say thank you for everything that. you send us, it&rsquo;s so dear all of it. but use a little more paper to wrrap it in.<span>&nbsp; </span>I guess I&rsquo;m cheeky now, it sounds as, if I take it for granted, that you should keep sending us packages, but I don&rsquo;t mean it like that, but it has all been so marvellous, and what I haven&rsquo;t been able to use I&rsquo;ve sold and gotten money for, as none of us earn much.<span>&nbsp; </span>I must end this now, and get the letter in the Mail.<span>&nbsp; </span>I wish that all of you will keep. well in every way<span>&nbsp; </span>say hello to all of ours from us.</p></p>\n<p>A thousand. dear. wishes. from us all.</p></p>\n<p>Mindor and Laura</p></p>\n<p>Stj&oslash;rdal <span>&nbsp;</span></p></p>"
