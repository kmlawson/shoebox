      "<p>Stj&oslash;rdal the 23/1-48<span>&nbsp; </span><em>(John died Jan. 13)</em></p></p>\n<p>Dear Uncle John.</p></p>\n<p>First I want to wish you all a Happy New Year which will bring more &ldquo;Peace&rdquo; among all peoples.<span>&nbsp; </span>And then I want to say thank you so much for the package that Eilif and I got just before Christmas.<span>&nbsp; </span>It was so much fun to get a greeting from Eilif&rsquo;s family in America. (As you&rsquo;ve probably guessed I&rsquo;m Eilif&rsquo;s wife) and I&rsquo;ve been wearing the slippers in the evenings and they are really nice to have, many thanks.<span>&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;s shameful that I haven&rsquo;t written earlier but it got postponed.<span>&nbsp; </span>On Dec. 30<sup>th</sup> we had a little daughter, she&rsquo;s now a little over 3 weeks old and round and chubby.<span>&nbsp; </span>Weighed 17 mark <em>(old Norwegian weight measurement)</em> when she was born.<span>&nbsp; </span>There&rsquo;s great excitement over the little one.<span>&nbsp; </span>Ragnhild who&rsquo;s 11 1/2 years old gets to change her alone now and both Stein and Turid very much like to be allowed to hold her.<span>&nbsp; </span>Likewise for her Daddy it&rsquo;s very popular, he often comes home from the bakery to see her being bathed.<span>&nbsp; </span>The little one will be named Helga Kristine, Helga for her father&rsquo;s mother and Kristine for her mother&rsquo;s mother.<span>&nbsp; </span>Stein is 9 years old and a big and tall boy, he&rsquo;s out skiing every day and now says that he has jumped 10 m <em>(*1 <span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>see note at end of letter).</em> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Turid will be 7 years old in April and will start school this fall.<span>&nbsp; </span>She has learnt to read now, and then she&rsquo;s a good singer.<span>&nbsp; </span>Ragnhild is in 5<sup>th</sup> grade and is really good in school.<span>&nbsp; </span>The children have been healthy and then all is well.</p></p>\n<p>This afternoon Herborg came here with a gift for little sister and then Granddad <em>(&ldquo;Farfar&rdquo; means father&rsquo;s father)</em> came here to eat.<span>&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;s so cold here today, minus 22 degrees and lots of snow.<span>&nbsp; </span>But it&rsquo;s so nice and warm here in the living room.<span>&nbsp; </span>Herborg is sitting here knitting, Eilif is reading a book and the children have gone to bed so it&rsquo;s nice and quiet.</p></p>\n<p>I hear from Herborg that you&rsquo;re sick and in the hospital, and that was sad to hear, the best of all is when one can be healthy.<span>&nbsp; </span>Often we don&rsquo;t appreciate that enough.<span>&nbsp; </span>My mother is 77 years old and has always been healthy.<span>&nbsp; </span>Friday before Christmas she became ill and it was so sad as we didn&rsquo;t know how it would go.<span>&nbsp; </span>But now she&rsquo;s up and well again.<span>&nbsp; </span>She&rsquo;ll probably come here on Sunday to see little sister.<span>&nbsp; </span>Mother has her birthday on the first day of Christmas <em>(this is what we call Dec. 25, we celebrate Christmas Eve)</em> and we usually get together at her place on that day, both big and small.<span>&nbsp; </span>Therefor the disappointment was great for the children when they weren&rsquo;t able to go to grandma&rsquo;s <em>(&ldquo;mormor&rdquo; means mother&rsquo;s mother)</em> on the first day of Christmas.<span>&nbsp; </span>We&rsquo;re so happy that she&rsquo;s well now and we hope to keep her for many years to come.<span>&nbsp; </span>On Christmas Eve Eilif, the children and I went to Granddad and Herborg&rsquo;s to have coffee with them and wish them Merry Christmas.<span>&nbsp; </span>Aunt Laura, Mindor, Einar and Astrid were there too, and we had a really nice time.<span>&nbsp; </span>Other than that we&rsquo;ve just been at home.<span>&nbsp; </span>The children have been to Christmas parties, but now they&rsquo;ve started school again <em>(* 2 <span>&nbsp;</span>see note at the end of this letter).</em> The biggest excitement is on Christmas Eve when the children are allowed to decorate the Christmas tree and decorate around the living room with pine twigs and juniper.<span>&nbsp; </span>Around 4-5 o&rsquo;clock we then have coffee accompanied by Christmas cookies <em>(any good housewife would have to bake at least 7 different kinds!)</em> and around 7-8 we eat dinner and the tradition is to have rib steak w. dessert.<span>&nbsp; </span>A little later Santa Claus arrives with gifts.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then we walk around the Christmas tree and after that we distribute all the gifts.<span>&nbsp; </span>It gets to be a lively Christmas Eve when there are children in the house.<span>&nbsp; </span>Christmas is the biggest of all holidays.<span>&nbsp; </span>On the 2<sup>nd</sup> day of Christmas <em>(Dec. 26)</em> the children were at V&aelig;rnes church to hear the children&rsquo;s sermon.</p></p>\n<p>When I had little sister I was at the Ward here at Halsen<em> (Stj&oslash;rdal is often called Stj&oslash;rdalshalsen or just Halsen)</em><span>&nbsp; </span>Eilif and the children visited me every day then, and that was so nice.<span>&nbsp; </span>Stein was a little disappointed that he didn&rsquo;t get a brother, but now he&rsquo;s <span style=–text-decoration: underline;–>so</span> fond of his little new sister.<span>&nbsp; </span>One day he said &ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t matter at all that it was a sister, it was good that she was healthy.&rdquo; And the fact that the children are normal and healthy becomes the greatest thing of all.</p></p>\n<p>I too have a brother in America.<span>&nbsp; </span>He has his wife and little 4 year old son with him. He&rsquo;s now living in Boston and likes it there.<span>&nbsp; </span>He&rsquo;s studying economics and has been a secretary for the Norwegian minister at a few UN meetings.<span>&nbsp; </span>He plans to stay in America for about 2 years.<span>&nbsp; </span>He's probably having a good learning experience over there.<span>&nbsp; </span>He writes that there are a lot of goods over there.<span>&nbsp; </span>There aren't&rsquo;many textiles here now, but we're lacking nothing.<span>&nbsp; </span>Of course there are various things that can&rsquo;t be found, but still I don&rsquo;t think many people are doing as well as we are here in Norway.<span>&nbsp; </span>No one needs to starve or be cold if they&rsquo;re willing to work.<span>&nbsp; </span>We really hope there will not be a new war.<span>&nbsp; </span>Eilif was gone for 1 1/2 year during the war and that was a sad time that we&rsquo;d rather not think about <em>(he was in concentration camps in Norway and Germany, see Axel Holm&rsquo;s letter dated July 29-1945)</em>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Fortunately he came out of it unharmed, but can be sleepless at various times.<span>&nbsp; </span>He dreams many a strange thing.</p></p>\n<p>Eilif asks me to greet you and your whole family and say thank you so much for all the things that were in the package.<span>&nbsp; </span>And we wish that you will soon get better from your illness.</p></p>\n<p>The time is now 24 <em>(12 midnight)</em> and everyone has gone to bed.<span>&nbsp; </span>Eilif starts at 4 o&rsquo;clock tomorrow morning at the bakery, but is then finished before noon.<span>&nbsp; </span>Well take care all of you and many thanks for the gifts for the children for Christmas<span>&nbsp; </span>They got 5 Dollars each from you under the Christmas tree.</p></p>\n<p>So Happy New Year again and lots of good wishes to You all from us here in Stj&oslash;rdal.</p></p>\n<p>Best wishes from Aase and Eilif Holm.</p></p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m sending pictures of the children.</p></p>\n<p><em>There&rsquo;s a lovely picture of Ragnhild at 7 years old, wearing a knitted hat and knitted sweater, one of Turid at 4 years old, and a photo of 4 small children:<span>&nbsp; </span>Ragnhild, Arild, Stein and Turid all wearing summer clothes and sitting on a lawn.<span>&nbsp; </span>Arild is probably Arne&rsquo;s son.<span>&nbsp; </span>Arne was another son of Axel&rsquo;s.</em></p></p>\n<p><em>*1)<span>&nbsp; </span>We used to create little ski jumps by packing the snow into a big lump, then flattening it out on top.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then we would go to the top of the hill and ski down; <span>&nbsp;</span>when we hit the ski jump we would fly quite far in the air before landing below it</em>.<span>&nbsp; </span><em>Sometimes local ski jumping competitions would be arranged, using &ldquo;home made&rdquo; jumps like that.</em></p></p>\n<p><em>*2) <span>&nbsp;</span>It&rsquo;s a tradition in Norway to have lots of public Christmas parties.<span>&nbsp; </span>People dress up in their best clothes for these.<span>&nbsp; </span>Sometimes there will be food or the traditional Christmas cookies, and some sort of entertainment.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then people will join hands and form circles around the tall Christmas tree; each circle will walk in a different direction while Christmas carols are sung.<span>&nbsp; </span>Later Santa will come with toys for the children.</em></p></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p></p>"
