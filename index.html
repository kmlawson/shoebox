            <p>Welcome to our online archive of over two hundred letters, cards, songs, poems, and other documents.

            <h2>Updates</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>2025.10.23</strong> - The collection has been given a <a href="https://huginn.net/shoebox/new/">new interface</a>. The <a href="https://huginn.net/shoebox/letters/">old interface</a> is still in place and links should work but it is an older version of Omeka and some functionality has been lost.</li>
                <li><strong>2011.5.28</strong> - We have been able to contact surviving relatives of the letter writers and secure their permission to make this letter collection public. It will no longer be password protected.</li>
                <li><strong>2010.1.1</strong> - Added 'Places' index and Google Maps interface; geocoded frequently mentioned locations.</li>
                <li><strong>2010.12.31</strong> - Completed the addition of letters. Added sortable index for all items in the collection. Added 'Corrections and Suggestions' script interface for all items.</li>
                <li><strong>2010.12.29</strong> - Replaced navigation bar with variety of sorting options for better discovery.</li>
                <li><strong>2010.12.26</strong> - All letters up to 1945 have been added and tagged. Created site logo.</li>
            </ul>
