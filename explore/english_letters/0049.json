      "<p>Stj&oslash;rdal the 17<sup>th</sup> of August 47</p></p>\n<p>Dear brother and you all.</p></p>\n<p>I have now been to Opdal to see Arne<span>&nbsp; </span>it&rsquo;s so beautiful there<span>&nbsp; </span>the mountains are partly covered in snow<span>&nbsp; </span>there&rsquo;s perpetual snow there, then you can see the raindeer wandering the snowdrifts, then there are nice green mountain farm meadows by them<span>&nbsp; </span>an unusual and wonderful country we have.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then I went to Sundals&oslash;ra to Jarl Holm Konrad&rsquo;s boy<span>&nbsp; </span>he&rsquo;s married to a little girl from here, Stokke is her name <em>(her full name was Julie Stokke.<span>&nbsp; </span>She has passed away, but my uncle Jarl is still alive [Sept. 2000] and still at Sundals&oslash;ra).</em><span>&nbsp; </span>Jarl is a dairyman and salmon fisher, he learnt the art of fishing from Tomas Tr&oslash;an our childhood neighbor from across the lines. Then we went to the mountains with the big Aura plant<span>&nbsp; </span>We were taken by railroad 800 hundred meters up in the air by railroad, and then into the mountains we went with the railroad that goes to the big dam constructions, when it&rsquo;s finished there will be tremendous power and electricity<span>&nbsp; </span>But it&rsquo;s so terrible to see how everybody who&rsquo;s involved in it are wasting the resources that we are being taxed for.<span>&nbsp; </span>They&rsquo;re shooting a tunnel in the mountain which is 1800. meters <span>&nbsp;</span>so big that a truck can drive in there, that&rsquo;s where the water will be collected to go to the power station<span>&nbsp; </span>a tremendous drop.</p></p>\n<p>The weather was nice and lots of fish in the waters.<span>&nbsp; </span>We stayed at a mountain farm.<span>&nbsp; </span>They&rsquo;re now going to move the cottages and mountain farms for the damming of the water.<span>&nbsp; </span>I also saw the spot where Per Nordsletten&rsquo;s rock cabin stood, when he came from the Lesja woods up there to fish and thereby keep himself and his family alive.<span>&nbsp; </span>There he fought his battles with the help of the god of his life, for people and country<span>&nbsp; </span>perhaps it&rsquo;s the answer to his prayers in the rock cabin on the wild mountain by the quiet lake, which has made our life so good today.<span>&nbsp; </span>Next Sunday if God gives grace I&rsquo;m going to Skogn for a children&rsquo;s gathering.<span>&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;s been a long time since a was in Hegra and visited my friends at the home now <em>(the nursing home where his wife Helga was for 2 years),</em> but will do that on Tuesday.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;m going to see Olava then<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;m sending you a little of the flower packet you sent me this spring<span>&nbsp; </span>it&rsquo;s in full bloom now.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;ll put some of it on mother&rsquo;s <em>(his wife&rsquo;s)</em> grave<span>&nbsp; </span>I was there today with some Aster, I&rsquo;ve ordered a grave stone now<span>&nbsp; </span>it cost 600. Kr.<span>&nbsp; </span>will get it next spring.</p></p>\n<p>The daughter of Nils Holm got married on Saturday to a boy from L&aring;nke who was at Falstad with me <em>(the camp he was in for a while during WW II, see letter dated July 29-1945)</em>.<span>&nbsp; </span>and life rolls on and we&rsquo;re getting old.<span>&nbsp; </span>Laura is getting ready to go to Narvik now but I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;ll dare to go<span>&nbsp; </span>she thinks the train will topple over into the sona<em> (Sona is the name of a local <span>&nbsp;</span>river)</em> and then she&rsquo;ll get wet.<span>&nbsp; </span>Mindor is going with her (nonsense)</p></p>\n<p>You must try to Write Jarl Holm Sundals&oslash;ra, via Trondheim Norway.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then you&rsquo;ll get yourself a poem in return.<span>&nbsp; </span>Brage and he are like Konrad in that they&rsquo;re both good at it <span>&nbsp;</span>all of them have a talent for rhyming <em>(Conrad published a book of poems and several short stories).</em></p></p>\n<p>Keep well all of you</p></p>\n<p>Greetings with Math. 17 1-9</p></p>\n<p>Axel Holm</p></p>\n<p>Here at home everything is fine<span>&nbsp; </span>it&rsquo;s berry season now.<span>&nbsp; </span>Cloudberries, blueberries, raspberries, strawberries, Cranberries and our childhood berries Skrikling <em>(I don&rsquo;t know what these are)</em> at R&oslash;vhaugen and Holmsjare <em>(the Holm fields).</em></p></p>"
