      "<p>Thank you for your letter, and everything you send to us.<span>&nbsp; </span>Had a letter from Johan the other day where he tells us he&rsquo;s not well, it&rsquo;s not good when it&rsquo;s the heart<span>&nbsp; </span>that&rsquo;s where life comes from the old bible book says.<span>&nbsp; </span>Here everything is the same, Ole is a little under the weather, but apparently doing better, it&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve been to visit him.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Laura has gotten a package from Inez? Nilsen (Vilson?). and she&rsquo;s so excited.<span>&nbsp; </span>We&rsquo;re having wonderful weather<span>&nbsp; </span>it&rsquo;s 5 degr now just before Christmas<span>&nbsp; </span>haven&rsquo;t had snow yet.</p></p>\n<p>My wife is a little better now, I say she&rsquo;s like a Lark on a beautiful May morning, tell Johan this and he&rsquo;ll dream about old Norway.<span>&nbsp; </span>Would you please ask Johan which month and year he left and how old he was and if he was a trained blacksmith and who he learned from, and where he was born if it was at the old the Palestina border<em> (the name of an area in Hegra, just below the Nedre Hembre farm, where Ola Markussen Hembre was from)</em> to Porktr&oslash;a towards the south and Kamnesset in the west, the Meraker railroad in the north with tr&oslash;plass <em>(this may be the same as Holmstr&oslash;)</em> and Stj&oslash;rdalselva <em>(the Stj&oslash;rdal river)</em> and sme Hans (Blacksmith Hans) in the background, yes this was a lot of questions but I think that it&rsquo;ll bring up old memories, and that wont hurt us, to compare the old days when people were thrifty, thankful, and frugal, and god fearing and were scared of evil.<span>&nbsp; </span>Today is the time of Demands, displeasure, bitterness, arrogance, ingratitude, strike, and little thanks for what we have<span>&nbsp; </span>nothing is right. everybody complains. and little fear of god and few have a need for the salvation in Jesus Christ.<span>&nbsp; </span>(<em>I suspect that the real reason behind him wanting to know these things about John is that he&rsquo;s already thinking about writing a piece about him in the local newspaper after his death. <span>&nbsp;</span>I have an old copy of John&rsquo;s obituary from the Stj&oslash;rdal newspaper, given to me by Einar Holm, Axel&rsquo;s son a few years back.<span>&nbsp; </span>All the above things that Axel is asking about John are mentioned in this obituary).</em></p></p>\n<p>Well now we have butchered our Christmas pig<span>&nbsp; </span>a thumping big one of 180 kg.<span>&nbsp; </span>I made most of it myself. both the mock brawn and the sausages, I was an apprentice with my dear Helga and as she unfortunately is not at home the old man has to manage on his own, and it went well, now I have cooked soap and it turned out fine.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;ve gone on to the cleaning up and am now a soap maker, tell big brother that.<span>&nbsp; </span>Helga is a little better now than before<span>&nbsp; </span>how long it&rsquo;ll last nobody knows.<span>&nbsp; </span>6 weeks ago I thought it was her last day.<span>&nbsp; </span>but I got her back for a while so God is good to us.<span>&nbsp; </span>Well now it&rsquo;ll soon be Christmas.<span>&nbsp; </span>Have a blessed Christmas and a rich New year, with strength from the Lord to both live and to die.</p></p>\n<p>My strength will be complete in your fragility <em>(no idea what he means).</em></p></p>\n<p>Best Christmas wishes from us all</p></p>\n<p>Helga.<span>&nbsp; </span>Axel.<span>&nbsp; </span>Es. 43: 1-2</p></p>\n<p><em>Written by Herborg:</em><span>&nbsp; </span>Dear Alma!<span>&nbsp; </span>I wish you all a very Merry Christmas and happy new year! Tell uncle Johan that both aunt Laura and I have received the packages with the shoes &ndash; galoshes - stockings etc.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thanks a lot!</p></p>\n<p>Best wishes from Herborg <span>&nbsp;</span></p></p>"
