      "FUNERAL FOR MASTER PAINTER JOH. ØYAN\n\nI don't think this is of any interest to you so I didn't translate it,  it just describes this man's funeral, he was obviously a friend of Axel's, as he mentions him and his family in a couple of his letters.  I'm beginning to think that Axel was a member of some kind of a religious order, because the word –lodge– is used in some of his letters, and also the term –brother–. He may even have been a Mason. I'll ask his daughter in law Astrid next time I speak to her.  Some of the mourners above are referred to as sisters or brothers of so and so order.  The only mention of Axel in the description of the funeral above is that he put down a wreath on behalf of the newly formed Christian association in Stjørdalen called the Friends, or the Association of the Friends."
