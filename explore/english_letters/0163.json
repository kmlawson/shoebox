      "<p>Thanks a lot for the books and especially for the <span style=–text-decoration: underline;–>bible</span> I&rsquo;ve had sent to me.<span>&nbsp; </span>That was nice to get in memory of you, uncle Johan!</p></p>\n<p>The money you sent it&rsquo;s been difficult to get exchanged.<span>&nbsp; </span>In the banks in this country it was impossible to get notes as large as 100 &ndash; and 50 dollars exchanged.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then I wrote to Sweden, but it was impossible in the banks there too.<span>&nbsp; </span>You see they&rsquo;re not allowed to take them, as there&rsquo;s been so many forged ones like that in circulation from the German days.<span>&nbsp; </span>But now I&rsquo;ve fortunately gotten them exchanged by a lady who&rsquo;s home, from U.S.A.<span>&nbsp; </span>I got a 50 dollar note, which I&rsquo;ll save for next summer.<span>&nbsp; </span>The others, 2 20 d. and one 10 d, I&rsquo;ll get exchanged into Swedish money using my passport.<span>&nbsp; </span>You see I&rsquo;m going to Sweden now for a 14 days&rsquo; vacation.<span>&nbsp; </span>We&rsquo;re going on a biking trip &ndash; 4 friends &ndash; and will sleep in a tent &ndash; have a coffeepot &ndash; frying pan etc. with us.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;m really looking forward to it!<span>&nbsp; </span>Biking and tent trips are a lot of fun! We&rsquo;ll go by train from Hell <em>(a place very close to Stj&oslash;rdal)</em>, to across the border a little ways (July 18) &ndash; then we&rsquo;ll bike along the road, over the Verdal mountains back.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;m going to buy myself various things for some of the money &ndash; the trip itself we&rsquo;ll make as cheap as possible.</p></p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve had a letter from Alma too, and will write to her as soon as possible.</p></p>\n<p>Today we&rsquo;ve had a visit from uncle Edward Eidum.<span>&nbsp; </span>He&rsquo;s staying with his son Erling who lives here in Stj&oslash;rdal.</p></p>\n<p>For two days now I&rsquo;ve been on my head in the carrot and flower beds pulling weeds &ndash; I&rsquo;ll tell you the &ldquo;inheritance&rdquo; is growing and thriving well! <em>(it sounds like John has sent them some seeds of some kind)</em>.</p></p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s been very warm here for a while, but tonight it&rsquo;s cooler and looking like rain.<span>&nbsp; </span>All day Sunday I was at the beach sunbathing and tanning myself.</p></p>\n<p>Father is in the potato field these days, pulling weeds.<span>&nbsp; </span>He&rsquo;s been to Opdal for a few days now &ndash; The China Mission had a regional meeting up there &ndash; so he visited Arne and family at the same time.<span>&nbsp; </span>Arne is working hard and carrying on with the baking and the loaves of bread are going fast.</p></p>\n<p>Einar has been in bed with a fever for a few days &ndash; bronchitis &ndash; but now he&rsquo;s up and working at the bakery again.<span>&nbsp; </span>Eilif and his wife have been to weddings 2 week-ends in a row now.<span>&nbsp; </span>They&rsquo;re doing just fine &ndash; by the way they&rsquo;re expecting a baby around Christmas time.<span>&nbsp; </span>They have 3 now.</p></p>\n<p>How are you doing now, uncle Johan!<span>&nbsp; </span>Alma writes that you&rsquo;re often sick and that&rsquo;s sad to think about.<span>&nbsp; </span>You ought to come home to the mother country, right?<span>&nbsp; </span>And how is your wife?<span>&nbsp; </span>You must give her my best regards!</p></p>\n<p>Last week I was in Levanger for a visit for a couple of days &ndash; it made a pleasant change.</p></p>\n<p>Aunt Laura has been here today.<span>&nbsp; </span>She&rsquo;s as usual.<span>&nbsp; </span>She was very happy about the money you sent her.<span>&nbsp; </span>Father hasn&rsquo;t gotten it to exchanged yet &ndash; but then Laura can get Norwegian money from him, any time she wants.<span>&nbsp; </span>Laura has really been wanting to go to Heggedal near Olso &ndash; where they came from &ndash; and visit her friends and acquaintances down there, but she doesn&rsquo;t know whether she can afford to spend the money on that.<span>&nbsp; </span>Feels like she ought to buy <span style=–text-decoration: underline;–>firewood</span> for the winter for it instead&ndash; but she hasn&rsquo;t quite decided yet.</p></p>\n<p>I heard Evelyn has written to you.<span>&nbsp; </span>Yes, I know the children are mad at uncle Ola because he&rsquo;s so sneeky with the packages he has gotten from you.<span>&nbsp; </span>They know nothing about what you&rsquo;ve sent you know, because he has it at his workshop in Nonnegaten &ndash; and is so secretive.<span>&nbsp; </span>Your other siblings received new, nice, patterned blankets &ndash; from you &ndash; but Ola came home to his wife with and old worn out blanket &ndash; which Evelyn has now cut up into rags for a rug.<span>&nbsp; </span>It was a bit strange, I think.<span>&nbsp; </span>Have you perhaps not sent a new blanket to them?</p></p>\n<p>I read a piece you had written in the magazine &ldquo;Utsyn&rdquo;.<span>&nbsp; </span>Uncle Edw. wanted to read it today, but we couldn&rsquo;t find the magazine.</p></p>\n<p>Thank you for the greetings we got through the Norwegian-American Hilmo from Tydal.<span>&nbsp; </span>He had a farm outside of Dell Rapids, he said.<span>&nbsp; </span>He thought it was so moving to be back in old Norway again &ndash; that he cried when he talked about it.</p></p>\n<p>Eilif sends you his very best wishes and so does father.<span>&nbsp; </span>Father is getting a lift to L&aring;nke to get <span style=–text-decoration: underline;–>firewood</span> tomorrow.</p></p>\n<p>Say hello to Alma w/family and keep real well, dear uncle Johan!</p></p>\n<p>Best wishes from Herborg</p></p>"
