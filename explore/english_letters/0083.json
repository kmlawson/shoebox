    "Description": [
      "I BELIEVE THIS IS ALMA'S TRANSLATION OF A LETTER FROM ODD HOLM TO GRACE.  THE NORWEGIAN ORIGINAL IS DATED CASABLANCA, MAY 28-1941, ODD AND HIS SHIPMATES FROM THE S/S RINGULV WERE SENT TO THE FIRST PRISON CAMP ON JULY 4. THE ENVELOPE IS IN BITS AND PIECES, BUT THE FOLLOWING CAN BE MADE OUT:  IT HAS BEEN –OUVERT– (OPENED) BEFORE IT LEFT MOROCCO, AND THEN IT LOOKS LIKE IT HAS BEEN CHECKED AGAIN IN LISBON, PORTUGAL ON JUNE 18-41.  IT HAS A BIG STICKER THAT SAYS –OPENED BY EXAMINER 4128–.  UP IN THE CORNER OF THAT STICKER IT SAYS IN SMALLER LETTERS –P.C. 90–.  IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO  SEE WHEN IT LEFT MOROCCO BUT THE NUMBER 5 AND THE LETTERS SA ARE  VERY CLEAR, SO IT MAY HAVE BEEN SENT FROM SAFI  ON JUNE 5-1941.  IT HAS THREE MOROCCAN STAMPS, A 1 FRANC, A 5 FRANC AND A 10 FRANC STAMP.  IT'S ADDRESSED TO MISS GRACE WILSON, 102 WEST FIFTH STREET, DELL RAPIDS, SOUTH DAKOTA, U.S.A., SENT –PAR AVION– (AIR MAIL)."
