      "<p>Well now it&rsquo;s about time we reply to your letter.<span>&nbsp; </span>I too Had a letter from Axel That they were at his house. Ole And Laura to divide the Money and were to send Hahnes to her and they all signed It with their names Herborg for Hannah. <span>&nbsp;</span>Also that it would be so kind and nice of us here to share the Estate With Olava and Gjertine.<span>&nbsp; </span>But as John has signed a Paper that none of his Relatives are to have anymore. There&rsquo;s nothing to divide when Mother&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s Son gets his back.<span>&nbsp; </span>And a funeral here in America isn&rsquo;t Cheap.<span>&nbsp; </span>Plus the Hospital Had to be paid too.<span>&nbsp; </span>And John was no Millionaire.<span>&nbsp; </span>Ole Knows How Much money Went while He was here in america. and a lot of it went the same way since that time.<span>&nbsp; </span>And if Axel adds up What all the packages cost that they got there that alone would be quite a bit.<span>&nbsp; </span>And lots of money has gone over there to norway for many years. Before the war came<span>&nbsp; </span>That shows in letters John received from the time he was back in 1914<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;m glad this is over with now.<span>&nbsp; </span>Tell me What Hannah bought for the Wedding <em>(meaning anniversary).</em> that would be fun to know.</p></p>\n<p>We&rsquo;ve heard nothing more from Ole nor his girls Since he got the money. he didn&rsquo;t want them to write to us and John before but after Evelyn went to see Axel one time they wrote to us Anyway and told John lots of things that he didn&rsquo;t know before that time.<span>&nbsp; </span>Well like I&rsquo;ve said he was very surprised about many things there.<span>&nbsp; </span>Also he was surprised about Axel<span>&nbsp; </span>He said to me on the last day No Alma Axel Is not the guy I thought he was. and I regret so many things now.<span>&nbsp; </span>But now it&rsquo;s too late.</p></p>\n<p>So in the future I want nothing more to do with him and Ole<span>&nbsp; </span>Laura can&rsquo;t do as she pleases either perhaps as she&rsquo;s in a position where she needs help from Axel now and then.<span>&nbsp; </span>The fact that they were so upset that Hanna and you got to know about this money in the Bank surprised me. That Herborg should scold me for that.<span>&nbsp; </span>You don&rsquo;t need to be afraid to tell me things<span>&nbsp; </span>what would surprise me there. As John told me so many things those last weeks.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;m glad I could be of some Help to him and mother these last few Years.</p></p>\n<p>Mother and I have both been unwell<span>&nbsp; </span>I with gall blather and flu mother with flu and she has pains from all these broken bones, don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ve told you that mother has broken both her hips <span>&nbsp;</span>broken her Right arm and right shoulder broken 3 times left arm twice.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;m so afraid she&rsquo;ll fall yet again and break bones. as I&rsquo;m not strong enough now to take care of her if she does.</p></p>\n<p>my elder son came home on sept 4/for 3 days<span>&nbsp; </span>had to go back then but came back last week for a longer period. and is going to help putting the Storm windows in and getting the place ready for winter. As Ralph has his shoe repair shop to take care of. As he borrowed a lot of money for it he has to work full time all the time.</p></p>\n<p>well I think this is just about enough now. you must write soon maybe we won&rsquo;t be able to write to eachother as often yet again<span>&nbsp; </span>these are strange times aren&rsquo;t they.</p></p>\n<p>can you find out if there&rsquo;ll be a lot of customs to pay on dolls that sleep from here to norway if they&rsquo;re marked Gift packages.<span>&nbsp; </span>We can buy them here now and I know Gusta wanted to Have one for her Niece.<span>&nbsp; </span>remember to tell me and say hello to all of yours there<span>&nbsp; </span>I got Karen letter but it was on its way for a long time<span>&nbsp; </span>it would be so much fun to meet sometime but I guess that will never happen.<span>&nbsp; </span>goodnight now and write soon, we&rsquo;re glad that Hannah got Her share</p></p>\n<p>Regards from MOTHER AND ALMA</p></p>"
