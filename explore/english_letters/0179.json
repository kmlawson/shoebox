      "<p>Dear Brother and all</p></p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ll, finally, write to you.<span>&nbsp; </span>Time gets too short, so one never gets as much done as one plans, I do various work at home to earn some extra kroner.<span>&nbsp; </span>And Mindor has been, out Picking Potatoes now so he has earned a little <em>(the farmers would hire people short term just to harvest his potatoes. <span>&nbsp;</span>We used to call it our potato vacation as we would get time off school in the fall around potato harvesting time to go to the various farms and help).</em><span>&nbsp; </span>As you probably know, I&rsquo;ve been to Narvik, I had such a Nice time.<span>&nbsp; </span>It was strange, to see Sister Hanna again, she can&rsquo;t see very well, is almost Blind, we haven&rsquo;t seen eachother, since in our Mother&rsquo;s Funeral, you wouldn&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve been in the Same Country.<span>&nbsp; </span>she&rsquo;s doing well in every way.<span>&nbsp; </span>Many nice children who, visit her every day almost, all the children have nice homes, and have work and are well, so it&rsquo;s going well, so now I&rsquo;ve been there, but it&rsquo;s almost as if, I felt it was wrong, to ruin so much money, even though it had been given to me, because I could have used it for this Winter, but not to worry that far in advance, we&rsquo;ll manage somehow then too.<span>&nbsp; </span>I hope that you&rsquo;re all doing well.<span>&nbsp; </span>greet Alma and tell her I&rsquo;ll write soon, I hope you&rsquo;ll get well enough to take a trip over here, yes who knows so many strange things happen.</p></p>\n<p>Keep very well all of you.<span>&nbsp; A thousand dear greetings from Laura and Mindor<span>&nbsp; </span>Stj&oslash;rdal</span></p></p>"
