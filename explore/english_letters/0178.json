      "<p>I&rsquo;ll write you a few words.<span>&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;s been so long since I heard from you.<span>&nbsp; </span>Are you perhaps too unwell to write?<span>&nbsp; </span>I really hope that&rsquo;s <span style=–text-decoration: underline;–>not</span> the case.</p></p>\n<p>I wrote you a letter before I went on vacation and then I sent you a postcard from &Oslash;stersund.<span>&nbsp; </span>We had a pleasant vacation.<span>&nbsp; </span>We were in &Oslash;stersund for 8 days and slept in a tent outside of town.<span>&nbsp; </span>Went shopping every day and they had lots of things there, fruit and sweets that we haven&rsquo;t seen for many years.<span>&nbsp; </span>We exchanged <span style=–text-decoration: underline;–>294</span> Norwegian kroner into <span style=–text-decoration: underline;–>210</span> Swedish kroner which we shopped for.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;ve exchanged 50 dollars which I got from you &ndash; 1 dollar is 3.60 Swedish kroner.<span>&nbsp; </span>The other 50 dollars is still whole and I&rsquo;ll save it for next summer.<span>&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;s still impossible to exchange such large notes both here and in Sweden.<span>&nbsp; </span>I got small dollar notes from a lady who was home from America<span>&nbsp; </span>1 dollar is about 4.90 in Norwegian money.<span>&nbsp; </span>Father hasn&rsquo;t managed to exchange the last money you sent him, but Laura has gotten her part in Norwegian notes about 125 kroner &ndash; from father &ndash; you wrote that she was to have 25 dollars of it - other than that he hasn&rsquo;t divided the rest, as he can&rsquo;t get it exchanged &ndash; but it can just wait for now.<span>&nbsp; </span>The dollar can&rsquo;t possibly lose its value can it?</p></p>\n<p>It was burning hot every day that we were in &Oslash;.<span>&nbsp; </span>One of the days we were there &ndash; it was warmer in &Oslash;stersund than anywhere in Europe!<span>&nbsp; </span>We biked all the way home &ndash; but then we had rain and the wind against us so it was hard.<span>&nbsp; </span>We were 5 ladies on the trip, and we bought ourselves shoes &ndash; various clothes &ndash; prunes &ndash; mixed - dried fruits etc.<span>&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;s very beautiful in &Oslash;.<span>&nbsp; </span>Most of the houses have red roofs &ndash; balconies with red awnings and flowers.<span>&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;s otherwise so clean and tidy there &ndash; lovely parks etc. and well dressed people &ndash; it&rsquo;s obvious that the war didn&rsquo;t touch them.<span>&nbsp; </span>I think the Norwegians are incredibly well dressed too, considering the fact that the clothing stores here were completely empty for 4-5 years.<span>&nbsp; </span>The only thing one could buy there &ndash; were paper handkerchiefs &ndash; paper towels and ditto curtains.<span>&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;s strange to think about <span style=–text-decoration: underline;–>now</span> &ndash; we <span style=–text-decoration: underline;–>couldn&rsquo;t</span> for example get hair combs &ndash; they had some made of wood and iron, other than that there was nothing to be had.<span>&nbsp; </span>nothing but sand soap to wash ourselves with &ndash; Now we&rsquo;re doing real well &ndash; nothing to complain about - but it was strange to see the well stocked stores in Sweden with all kinds of nice, good items<span>&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;s getting more strict here again &ndash; now we can&rsquo;t buy cream and butter at the dairy anymore &ndash; that&rsquo;s only for small children and old people &ndash; but other than that we have more than enough food.<span>&nbsp; </span>We can buy meat for each week end &ndash; rationed.</p></p>\n<p>We&rsquo;ve had glorious weather through all of August.<span>&nbsp; </span>It hasn&rsquo;t been as warm and dry as that in Aug. since <span style=–text-decoration: underline;–>1816</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>But now it&rsquo;s fall like &ndash; with a cold wind &ndash; rain and dark evenings.<span>&nbsp; </span>We&rsquo;re harvesting our potatoes these days &ndash; but had to put it on hold today, due to rain.<span>&nbsp; </span>Hope it&rsquo;ll get better tomorrow, so that we can continue.<span>&nbsp; </span>Father is at the graveyard now fixing up mother&rsquo;s grave.<span>&nbsp; </span>He had picked some nice rocks by Viksj&oslash;en, which he&rsquo;s going to decorate it with. &ndash; I have warm greetings for you from Julie Brekken and her daughter Oline!<span>&nbsp; </span>They remember you very well from the time you were here in 1914.<span>&nbsp; </span>Julie was the caretaker of the lodge at that time and she said that you were so nice and that you frequently came up to her for a chat.<span>&nbsp; </span>By the way there are so many who remember you when I talk about you and tell them about the packages and letters you&rsquo;ve sent.</p></p>\n<p>Today Laura has been here to do her laundry.<span>&nbsp; </span>There&rsquo;s no laundry room where she lives you see <em>(she&rsquo;s using the term &ldquo;st&oslash;rhus&rdquo; which was a separate building where the butchering of animals took place, and other jobs that required access to running water, like the brewing of beer, the washing of clothes etc.)</em><span>&nbsp; </span>Laura has been to Narvik for 8 days to visit Hanna and her family.<span>&nbsp; </span>She had a pleasant time there &ndash; but the trip home was scary, she says.<span>&nbsp; </span>She went by bus over Saltfjellet <em>(a mountain)</em> &ndash; Dunderlandsdalen to Mo i Rana &ndash; with ferries several times.<span>&nbsp; </span>There&rsquo;s such wild &ndash; frightening scenery up north. Precipitous drops down on one side of the road and precipitous mountains up towards the sky on the other side.<span>&nbsp; </span>She was very scared on the bus ride but she did survive it! -<span>&nbsp; </span>Klara Krogstad from Trondheim was her today, just a quick visit.</p></p>\n<p>Father had a letter from Alma last week &ndash; I&rsquo;ve also had a letter from her by the way, a long time ago, you must greet her from me &ndash; and tell her that I&rsquo;ll write to <span style=–text-decoration: underline;–>her</span> soon too.</p></p>\n<p>Last Saturday I was at a wedding.<span>&nbsp; </span>A friend of mine, got married.<span>&nbsp; </span>We had a real good time &ndash; with singing and music&ndash; lots of good food &ndash; party games etc. till 4 in the morning.</p></p>\n<p>Uncle Ola has also been to Narvik this summer.<span>&nbsp; </span>He came by here on his way home &ndash; had had a pleasant trip &ndash; Hanna enjoyed seeing two of her siblings.<span>&nbsp; </span>They hadn&rsquo;t seen eachother for about 30 years.<span>&nbsp; </span>Laura said to give you her best regards!</p></p>\n<p>Say hello to your wife from me and father.<span>&nbsp; </span>Likewise to Alma and family.<span>&nbsp; </span>I got an amateur photo from A. and see that little Ruth Irene &ndash; Ralph&rsquo;s daughter &ndash; has gotten quite big now.</p></p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m sending you two amateur photos of little Helge and me.<span>&nbsp; </span>Helge&rsquo;s mother &ndash; Astrid &ndash; is taking sewing classes now, so Helge is with us every afternoon.<span>&nbsp; </span>&ndash; Father just came home so I must get him something to eat.<span>&nbsp; </span>Keep real well, uncle!<span>&nbsp; </span>and write again if you can!</p></p>\n<p>Loving greetings from Herborg.</p></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p></p>"
