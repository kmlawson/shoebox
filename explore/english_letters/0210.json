      "<p>First, I want to convey my Condolences for John, yes, now his struggles here in this world are over, the group of Siblings is getting smaller, one by one is going, soon it&rsquo;ll be our turn, who are still alive, but that&rsquo;s how it goes, the young may Die and the old must Die, no way around that.<span>&nbsp; </span>I guess John was Sick a lot, towards the end, so it was probably the best thing for him to be let go, when he was so old.<span>&nbsp; </span>But I feel it&rsquo;s, a little strange, to think about, still, even if he was so far away, he went as a youth, from Mother and Father and Siblings, Far away to a foreign country, to seek his Fortune, and now he Lies buried in a foreign Land in foreign Dirt, but that has less importance, when the Soul goes to God, we&rsquo;ll meet again, with ours, both those, of ours whom we know and those we&rsquo;ve never seen, we must believe that which is Written, that it&rsquo;s true.<span>&nbsp; </span>We are living as usual<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;m Sick a lot, I was sick here recently, and it looked, like, I wouldn&rsquo;t get better again, I had an Attack where I was, completely out for a couple of hours, I can easily get it again.<span>&nbsp; </span>Mindor has been at a Butcher&rsquo;s, a while, but then he&rsquo;s quite often at home and is unwell, but the days pass one by one.<span>&nbsp; </span>You must write a few words some time so that I&rsquo;ll hear how you&rsquo;re doing, greet all our relatives.</p></p>\n<p>A thousand dear wishes from Laura and Mindor<span>&nbsp; </span>Stj&oslash;rdal</p></p>\n<p>regards from Axel&rsquo;s.</p></p>"
