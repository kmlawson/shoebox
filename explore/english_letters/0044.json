      "<p>Stj&oslash;rdal the 9-6-48</p></p>\n<p>Dear Alma and all of you.</p></p>\n<p>When I last wrote to you, about these papers which we must have so that we can get your gift, I said that Einar was sick and you will be hearing from me later, on how he does.<span>&nbsp; </span>He had a <span style=–text-decoration: underline;–>small</span> tumor in his chest not on the lung, but now he has been going to the doctor&rsquo;s for treatment, and it looks like he&rsquo;s in good shape now, and has started at the bakery.<span>&nbsp; </span>Laura was just here<span>&nbsp; </span>she&rsquo;s in good shape<span>&nbsp; </span>Mindor likewise<span>&nbsp; </span>He&rsquo;s at the butcher&rsquo;s shop and is a good boy.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;ve now been travelling around holding children&rsquo;s meetings.<span>&nbsp; </span>Tonight I&rsquo;m going for a 4 day summer school in Skogn.</p></p>\n<p>Olav turns 70 years old tomorrow June 10 so he&rsquo;s an old man now. (Ola boy).<span>&nbsp; </span>Laura is not going there, short on income she said.<span>&nbsp; </span>Herborg is still at home with me and is a kind lady.</p></p>\n<p>Eilif has had, a really bad cold but I guess it&rsquo;ll pass soon.<span>&nbsp; </span>At Arne&rsquo;s they&rsquo;re doing well<span>&nbsp; </span>they were home a while back, it&rsquo;s strange how time rolls and we with it.</p></p>\n<p>You could see to those papers soon now, I would think you&rsquo;ve received my last letter.<span>&nbsp; </span>It would be nice if you would be so kind as to send them as soon as possible.<span>&nbsp; </span>As you already know Hanna has bought the memory gift from Johan<span>&nbsp; </span>she was a bit early, but we would think things can be sorted out with the bank.<span>&nbsp; </span>So that the money can be withdrawn.<span>&nbsp; </span>It was regrettable that the bank should come out with such demands. <span>&nbsp;</span>In a gift matter like this.</p></p>\n<p>Keep well all of you and be greeted from us all.</p></p>\n<p>Yours Axel</p></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p></p>"
