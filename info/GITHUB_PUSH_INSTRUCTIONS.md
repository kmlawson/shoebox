## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

Go to GitHub and create a new repository:

### Option A: Via GitHub Web Interface

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Fill in the repository details:
   - **Repository name:** `shoebox`
   - **Description:** `A Shoebox of Norwegian Letters - Digital archive of Norwegian-American family correspondence (1911-1956)`
   - **Visibility:** Choose Public or Private
   - **‚ùå DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
3. Click **"Create repository"**

### Option B: Via GitHub CLI (if installed)

```bash
gh repo create shoebox \
  --description "A Shoebox of Norwegian Letters - Digital archive of Norwegian-American family correspondence (1911-1956)" \
  --public  # or --private
```

## Step 2: Connect Your Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository on GitHub, you'll see instructions. Use these commands:

### If you chose a public repository:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/shoebox.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### If you chose a private repository:

Same commands as above - just make sure you created it as private on GitHub.

### Using SSH instead of HTTPS:

If you have SSH keys set up:

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/shoebox.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Authentication failed"

**Problem:** GitHub requires authentication

**Solution (HTTPS):**
```bash
# GitHub now requires a personal access token instead of password
# Create one at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
# Use the token as your password when prompted
```

**Solution (SSH):**
```bash
# Set up SSH keys: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh
```

### "Repository already exists"

**Problem:** You already created a repo with this name

**Solution:**
```bash
# Either delete the old repo on GitHub, or use a different name:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/shoebox-letters.git
```

### "Updates were rejected"

**Problem:** Remote has changes you don't have locally

**Solution:**
```bash
# Force push (only safe for initial push)
git push -u origin main --force
```

### "Large files detected"

**Problem:** Some files are over GitHub's 100MB limit

**Solution:** This shouldn't happen - we excluded large files. If it does:
```bash
# Check what large files exist
git ls-files -z | xargs -0 du -h | sort -rh | head -20
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **After pushing, strongly consider rotating these credentials that were exposed during setup:**

1. **MySQL Password:** `LC1yrYbAvsjWx8wGE3`
   - Change via your hosting control panel
   - Update `letters/db.ini` locally

2. **Guestbook Admin Password:** `23ogVindhc`
