      "<p>If Hanna had been well, I probably would have visited You this Summer.<span>&nbsp; </span>I could have gotten passage on an Ore ship to America, and That&rsquo;s also cheap.<span>&nbsp; </span>But Since Hanna is not well, and can&rsquo;t get around like she wants to, I can&rsquo;t go on any long trips, at least not any time soon.</p></p>\n<p>No Alma.<span>&nbsp; </span>You&rsquo;ll have to come here and see us.<span>&nbsp; </span>I can promise You that I&rsquo;ll take good care of You, during The time You&rsquo;re here.<span>&nbsp; </span>But I understand that you too are tied to Yours There.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then I&rsquo;ve also been to Vester&aring;len to visit Aagodt and all of hers.<span>&nbsp; </span>She told me to give you her best regards, and then They would write themselves she said.<span>&nbsp; </span>After that I went to Sjomm(?) to visit our Daughter Hilma and hers There.<span>&nbsp; </span>Hilma is here visiting now.<span>&nbsp; </span>We&rsquo;ve had a Lot of strangers all Summer both from Norway and Sweden (<em>I&rsquo;ve left this like he says it, &ldquo;strangers&rdquo; in this case is a Tr&oslash;ndelag expression for &ldquo;visitors&rdquo;).</em><span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;ve estimated that I&rsquo;ve travelled by Car and Railroad about exactly 350 Norwegian Miles.<span>&nbsp; </span>Or 2450.00 English ones.<span>&nbsp; </span>And That&rsquo;s not bad for me in a vacation.<span>&nbsp; </span>I have also received a letter from Carrie Mae.<span>&nbsp; </span>The widow of my brother.<span>&nbsp; </span>They live in Galesburg North Dakota.<span>&nbsp; </span>Likewise from my Sister Marie<span>&nbsp; </span>Anna and Bergljot I haven&rsquo;t heard anything from for a long time.</p></p>\n<p>Well well Alma.<span>&nbsp; </span>You&rsquo;re so kind to be working so hard for Yours.<span>&nbsp; </span>And not only for Them.<span>&nbsp; </span>But you have time and caring enough for others too.<span>&nbsp; </span>Therefore I&rsquo;d wish I were so close to You that I could thank You really warmly.<span>&nbsp; </span>There&rsquo;s something really strange about us Humans.<span>&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;s not everyone we can have complete confidence in.<span>&nbsp; </span>No It&rsquo;s the Disposition and Temperament that are so completely different.<span>&nbsp; </span>There&rsquo;s much too little intimacy between people, even if they are fairly close to you. It&rsquo;s The pure and honest mind of a child that is lacking.<span>&nbsp; </span>Love is a word which is foreign to most people of our time, though Love is The only Force, which can warm and melt The hardest ice.<span>&nbsp; </span>Well keep well our dear Alma in spite of it all.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;m sending a couple of pictures.</p></p>\n<p>Yours E. Eidum<span>&nbsp; </span>box 68.<span>&nbsp; </span>Narvik<span>&nbsp; </span>Norge</p></p>"
