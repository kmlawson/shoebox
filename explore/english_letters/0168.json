      "<p><span style=–font-style: normal;–>Many thanks for your letter, the bookmark and the songs I got.<span>&nbsp; </span>I thought that was very nice to get.</span></p></p>\n<p><span style=–font-style: normal;–>You write that you&rsquo;re very sick now and again.<span>&nbsp; </span>That&rsquo;s too bad, but on the other hand I guess it&rsquo;s only to be expected, since your age is so high.<span>&nbsp; </span>But I see you&rsquo;re not fearing death, so you&rsquo;re probably calm about your illness too.</span></p></p>\n<p><span style=–font-style: normal;–>I just visited uncle Aksel.<span>&nbsp; </span>He was home alone, Herborg had gone on vacation to Sweden.</span></p></p>\n<p><span style=–font-style: normal;–>Father has now put out the letter you sent him, so that we&rsquo;ve all gotten to read it.<span>&nbsp; </span>So that matter is now finished and done with.</span></p></p>\n<p><span style=–font-style: normal;–>Father and mother are doing fairly well.<span>&nbsp; </span>Mother turned 71 on July 24.<span>&nbsp; </span>She looks a lot younger I think. (ha-ha)<span>&nbsp; </span>You know we children would rather not have our parents get old, but that&rsquo;s life.</span></p></p>\n<p><span style=–font-style: normal;–>We&rsquo;re having such miserable summer weather here now, it&rsquo;s cold and raining, but then we did have about 14 days with warm and nice weather, so I guess we should be content.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;m off for 2 months in the summer, the nursery school has the same vacation as the schools.</span></p></p>\n<p><span style=–font-style: normal;–>I&rsquo;m thinking about getting married now, but unfortunately we have no place to live.<span>&nbsp; </span>Looks like there&rsquo;s a housing shortage everywhere after the war.<span>&nbsp; </span>We&rsquo;ll probably get married and live separately, even though that&rsquo;s not very pleasant.</span></p></p>\n<p><span style=–font-style: normal;–>I&rsquo;m sending you a couple of photos.<span>&nbsp; </span>Jon (my fiance) took one of them this Christmas.<span>&nbsp; </span>Behind me there&rsquo;s a lamp that father made out of grenades, original and strange.<span>&nbsp; </span>He&rsquo;s made a smaller one too which is on a big column.<span>&nbsp; </span>They were made a long time ago, so maybe you saw them when you were here?<span>&nbsp; </span>At the same time I&rsquo;m sending a picture of my Jon, your namesake.<span>&nbsp; </span>Do you like him?</span></p></p>\n<p><span style=–font-style: normal;–>Mother and father send you their best regards and so do everyone here.<span>&nbsp; </span>Say hello to auntie, Alma and all our relatives over there from us.<span>&nbsp; </span>Hope you both are well now.</span></p></p>\n<p><span style=–font-style: normal;–>Best wishes from Evelyn!</span></p>\r\n<span style=–font-size: 12pt; font-family: Times;–> </span></p>\n<p><span style=–font-style: normal;–>LETTER FROM EVELYN HOLM DATED AUGUST 1 &ndash; 1947, IN THE SAME ENVELOPE AS LETTER DATED JULY 31.</span></p></p>\n<p><span style=–font-style: normal;–>Trondheim 1-8-47</span></p></p>\n<p><span style=–font-style: normal;–>Dear uncle John!</span></p></p>\n<p><span style=–font-style: normal;–>Received your letter with enclosure today.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thank you so much.<span>&nbsp; </span>It comes in useful, as there&rsquo;s a lot we need, and everything is so expensive, but I think it&rsquo;s too much, with everything you keep sending.</span></p></p>\n<p><span style=–font-style: normal;–>I wrote you a letter last night.<span>&nbsp; </span>Today I received yours, so I&rsquo;ll enclose another page, so that you&rsquo;ll see that your letter got here ok.</span></p></p>\n<p><span style=–font-style: normal;–>Mother and I have been home alone.<span>&nbsp; </span>Looks like father has gone to the North of Norway.<span>&nbsp; </span>We received a postcard from him the other day from Troms&oslash;, and he was about to go further north then.<span>&nbsp; </span>I think he wants to see Nordkapp.<span>&nbsp; </span>He has always talked about taking a trip up north, so we thought it was nice that he got to do it.<span>&nbsp; </span>Father was also going to see aunt Helga </span>(she probably means Hanna)<span style=–font-style: normal;–> in Narvik.<span>&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;s been many years now since they&rsquo;ve visited or met eachother.</span></p></p>\n<p><span style=–font-style: normal;–>Mother went to see Agnes today.<span>&nbsp; </span>They live right across the fjord now in the summer months.<span>&nbsp; </span>Yesterday I was at Sonja&rsquo;s, they have a cabin a little ways outside of town.<span>&nbsp; </span>She said she had received a letter from you.<span>&nbsp; </span>So she&rsquo;ll probably write to you again<span>&nbsp; </span>Gerd and Effi are on vacation in Romsdalen near where mother comes from.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;m now thinking about going some place or other in August.<span>&nbsp; </span>Jon has started in a new job and he wont get a vacation, therefore I mostly stay put.<span>&nbsp; </span>I spend less money that way, and we&rsquo;re supposed to be saving.</span></p></p>\n<p><span style=–font-style: normal;–>Mother says thank you for the greetings and the money.<span>&nbsp; </span>She read your letter before she left today.<span>&nbsp; </span>She sends her regards back.<span>&nbsp; </span>Mother will no doubt buy herself something she&rsquo;d like to have for what you sent.</span></p></p>\n<p><span style=–font-style: normal;–>Are you having trouble understanding what I write?<span>&nbsp; </span>Wish I could write it on a typewriter.</span></p></p>\n<p><span style=–font-style: normal;–>Jon will type the address on the envelope.<span>&nbsp; </span>He says hello.</span></p></p>\n<p><span style=–font-style: normal;–>So keep well, hope you&rsquo;re not in pain all the time, even though you&rsquo;re sick.</span></p></p>\n<p><span style=–font-style: normal;–>Thank you so much again, uncle.</span></p></p>\n<p><span style=–font-style: normal;–>Best wishes Evelyn!</span></p></p>\n<p><em>Judging by many of the letters written around this time it looks like John has started to give away his money.<span>&nbsp; </span>One after the other writes to tell him thank you for the money.<span>&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;s as if he knows he doesn&rsquo;t have much time left, and wont need his money much longer!<span>&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;s understandable that Alma and Karoline were a bit bitter after his death, when the quarrel over his money in the bank in Stj&oslash;rdal started!</em></p></p>\n<p><span style=–font-style: normal;–>&nbsp;</span></p></p>\n<p><span style=–font-style: normal;–><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p></p>\n<p><span style=–font-style: normal;–>&nbsp;</span></p></p>\n<p><span style=–font-style: normal;–>&nbsp;</span></p></p>"
