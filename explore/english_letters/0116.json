      "<p>Stj&oslash;rdal Tuesday the 19<sup>th</sup> of February 1946</p></p>\n<p>Dear brother and you all</p></p>\n<p>Thank you so much for the package I got today.<span>&nbsp; </span>It contained a Jacket a pair of new half soled shoes and 2 soaps.<span>&nbsp; </span>They were nice things and fit perfectly, the jacket I am now wearing as I&rsquo;m writing to you.<span>&nbsp; </span>After I&rsquo;ve eaten I&rsquo;m going to bike to Hegre to visit the wife<span>&nbsp; </span>then I&rsquo;ll wear it so that she can see it<span>&nbsp; </span>it&rsquo;s nice and warm, when I&rsquo;m sitting in that cold room during my visit.<span>&nbsp; </span>I was there on Sunday<span>&nbsp; </span>she sends her best regards.<span>&nbsp; </span>She&rsquo;s okey but the doctor saw while examining her last time that there was nothing that could be done for her.<span>&nbsp; </span>she&rsquo;s saved and is not afraid but is waiting to see our savior again.</p></p>\n<p>Konrad&rsquo;s Brage was here the other day<span>&nbsp; </span>things were fine with him.<span>&nbsp; </span>Olav&rsquo;s and Laura&rsquo;s are fine.<span>&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;s quiet and calm here<span>&nbsp; </span>there&rsquo;s tidying up taking place after the Germans and the Nazis, We are now expecting the death penalty for one Rinnan <em>(a famous Nazi in Norway)</em> who has been ravaging here and who&rsquo;s guilty of Eilif&rsquo;s and my arrest<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;ll send you a newspaper so that you can see his escapades, he&rsquo;s from Levanger and lived on poverty relief his whole life but during the war he managed to get a salary of 300.000 a year.<span>&nbsp; </span>If negroes had come here he would have been with them <em>(I don&rsquo;t quite understand what he means here, but I do remember way back when in Hegra we were taught in school that the negroes in Africa were heathens who were to be pitied and had to be &ldquo;saved&rdquo;.<span>&nbsp; </span>It wasn&rsquo;t as much racism as a form of a fanatically &ldquo;religious&rdquo; and ignorant attitude, as if &ldquo;we&rdquo; were a step above, not because we were white, but because we had heard about Jesus.<span>&nbsp; </span>I guess it stemmed partly from the early days of missionaries who referred to them as &ldquo;savages&rdquo;, and partly, like I said <span>&nbsp;</span>from sheer ignorance).</em></p></p>\n<p>We have now been having terrible weather snow drifts and storms of the big kind.<span>&nbsp; </span>you can take a little plane trip over here now and we&rsquo;ll go for a walk, and I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll get Norwegian red roses on your old face.<span>&nbsp; </span>because it&rsquo;s biting real good now <span>&nbsp;</span>if we walked across <span style=–text-decoration: underline;–>porktr&oslash;a</span> <em>(name of a place in Hegra)</em> you remember that don&rsquo;t you, and also pe bakken <em>(a local name for a small hill in Hegra, probably named so because a fellow named Pe or Per had his house nearby)</em> where we hauled fire wood for mother and father in our younger years.<span>&nbsp; </span>I think it was stupid of me to leave Hegra because since then I&rsquo;ve grown so old<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;ll soon be 61 years old ouch.<span>&nbsp; </span>Well now I&rsquo;m going to eat cured pork which my daughter in law Astrid has made.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then I&rsquo;ll be off to Hegre to my sweetheart there at the nursing home.<span>&nbsp; </span>We are now going to have youth week at the chapel for the China mission this week<span>&nbsp; </span>starts tonight. <span>&nbsp;</span>hope we&rsquo;ll have a good time together that the Lord in his mercy will bless us.<span>&nbsp; </span>to be his children is a blessing, he carries us through all adversity, and then he takes us up in Glory.<span>&nbsp; </span>You must greet Alma&rsquo;s from us.<span>&nbsp; </span>So keep well and let us daily meet in front of the throne of mercy, before we call he will answer.<span>&nbsp; </span>it&rsquo;s snowing and blowing outside.<span>&nbsp; </span>so it&rsquo;ll be a strenuous trip for me to Hegra but love conquers all.</p></p>\n<p>Best wishes Helga and Axel<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rom 8.1.</p></p>"
