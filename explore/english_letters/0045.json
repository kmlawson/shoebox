      "<p>Stj&oslash;rdal the 10-7-1946</p></p>\n<p>Dear brother John and all of you.</p></p>\n<p>Thank you for the letter which I received several days ago.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thank you for the package I received yesterday, it contained 2 short pants, 1 suit, 1 dress, a silk ladies undershirt, 1 bag of stamps, thank you so much.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thank you for the package we got today for the wife<span>&nbsp; </span>it contained 1 blanket, a spool of thread, 1 key 1 crowbar.<span>&nbsp; </span>Mother says a Thousand thanks, the blanket will be very nice and warm.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;ve been to see her today<span>&nbsp; </span>she sends her regards to you all<span>&nbsp; </span>she had a fever of 38.1 (temp).<span>&nbsp; </span>So according to human calculations she&rsquo;s bad, so she probably wont come home to us alive.<span>&nbsp; </span>That depends on the Lord, his way is not our way, so she&rsquo;s in his hand<span>&nbsp; </span>he wont forsake his own on the day of need.<span>&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;s cold here<span>&nbsp; </span>a very bad summer as far as temperatures.<span>&nbsp; </span>but things are growing nicely so it looks like there will be good crops.<span>&nbsp; </span>If only the people could be satisfied but constant complaints about bad prices, so it&rsquo;s difficult to get anything done.<span>&nbsp; </span>In Finnmark they pay 5 kr. an hr. <span>&nbsp;</span>40 kr. a day for the rebuilding.<span>&nbsp; </span>completely hopeless, in my opinion,<span>&nbsp; </span>Society can&rsquo;t live under such circumstances.<span>&nbsp; </span>There&rsquo;s bound to be a crash economically in a few years, this will never work.<span>&nbsp; </span>There&rsquo;s enough work here but few will work, but be supported by the state and live in a whirl of pleasures, in drinking and dancing, in (sin) and if there&rsquo;s too little then demand more, and the state takes taxes out of the frugal and hard working, while the riff-raff live for free.<span>&nbsp; </span>The country will never survive, and when will the people wake up, and the authorities use common sense.<span>&nbsp; </span>May the Lord have mercy on us so that we don&rsquo;t end up in a new and worse situation than the one we&rsquo;re just finished with.<span>&nbsp; </span>At Olav&rsquo;s everything is fine. Likewise at Olava&rsquo;s<span>&nbsp; </span>Odd is home in Norway now, he has been a little sick but is fine now, has come home from the Hospital.<span>&nbsp; </span>Laura is not well<span>&nbsp; </span>she has too little stomach acid.<span>&nbsp; </span>can&rsquo;t handle her food, but is now getting acid so now she&rsquo;s doing better.<span>&nbsp; </span>Our Arne has started his own bakery in Opdal<span>&nbsp; </span>you must visit him next summer when you come, I guess you feel you&rsquo;re a little too youthful today to take a trip to Norway this year.<span>&nbsp; </span>The coffee is warm.</p></p>\n<p>So live well all of you over there, and thank you for everything.</p></p>\n<p>Best wishes Helga and Axel.</p></p>\n<p>Herborg just went out for a while<span>&nbsp; </span>she said to tell you thank you very much, Herborg is a big tall lady.</p></p>\n<p>good night.</p></p>"
