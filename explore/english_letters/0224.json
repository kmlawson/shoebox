      "<p>Thanks a lot for your letter and the death certificate I got.<span>&nbsp; </span>But you see the bank wanted a Statement from you, that this which is a gift does not belong to Johan&rsquo;s estate.<span>&nbsp; </span>It would be good if your mother states whether she retains undivided possession of the estate, like we do things here.<span>&nbsp; </span>I think there would be more noise if we went through <span style=–text-decoration: underline;–>the consulate</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>But if you can&rsquo;t give us such a statement, that you waive the right to the money which is a gift from you we have to turn to them, and then it will all go to the estate so that we&rsquo;ll be entitled to inheritance along with you. I can&rsquo;t think of another way.<span>&nbsp; </span>In Norwegian money with interest it&rsquo;s kr. 5160,05.<span>&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;</span><em>(Norwegians add the comma, instead of a period, so this would be five thousand one hundred and sixty kroner and 05 &oslash;re; <span>&nbsp;</span>100 &oslash;re to 1 kr.).</em> Expecting a good result.</p></p>\n<p>Yours Axel</p></p>\n<p><em>I&rsquo;m not sure, but I don&rsquo;t think they would be entitled to anything in John&rsquo;s estate unless his wife and children were also gone, so I think what Axel means here is that he and his siblings will be entitled to inheritance of John&rsquo;s estate according to the rules and regulations, rather than meaning they&rsquo;re entitled to anything at all from the estate while Karoline and Alma are still alive.</em></p></p>"
