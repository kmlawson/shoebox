      "LETTER FROM ALMA WILSON DATED FEBRUARY 20 â€“ 1948, TO OLA HOLM.  NO ENVELOPE.  IT LOOKS LIKE SHE HAS USED CARBON PAPER TO MAKE A COPY OF THIS LETTER FOR HERSELF.  HER NORWEGIAN IS REALLY GOOD, IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE SHE NEVER LIVED IN NORWAY.  SHE USES THE OLD DANISH STYLE GRAMMAR AND SPELLING."
