      "<p>Dear Alma and Mother.</p></p>\n<p>Thank you for the letter that we got from You 4 days ago.<span>&nbsp; </span>First I must tell You, that the letter we now received from You had been at the bottom of the ocean before we got It.<span>&nbsp; </span>It was on The plane that crashed near Trondheim a few days ago, and where 19 People were killed.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thank you for all the pictures that were enclosed.<span>&nbsp; </span>Though They were melted together by the water, and everything written on them was gone.<span>&nbsp; </span>But most of the letter was readable.<span>&nbsp; </span>We&rsquo;re doing as usual here.<span>&nbsp; </span>Hanna is still sitting here with pain in her legs.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;ve recently been to Trondheim.<span>&nbsp; </span>Was There to visit a doctor Specialist.<span>&nbsp; </span>I have a little trouble with the Nerves in my chest.<span>&nbsp; </span>Fortunately I don&rsquo;t have any heart disease the doctor said.<span>&nbsp; </span>But the X-rays showed that It was the Nerves around my heart that have had too much strain, and probably during the War years.<span>&nbsp; </span>But I hope that It&rsquo;ll improve a little.<span>&nbsp; </span>You ask what Hanna bought herself for the money she got from America.<span>&nbsp; </span>She&rsquo;s bought herself two Chairs, which are just right for her to sit in.<span>&nbsp; </span>And then she has given away a few kroner to a couple of families in need of help.<span>&nbsp; </span>And then she has a few kroner, that is What&rsquo;s left of the amount set aside, and is waiting to hear, if Gjertine and Olava are to have some of the amount.<span>&nbsp; </span>When I was at Axel&rsquo;s one night, I went to Stj&oslash;rdal from Trondheim, I met Klara Gjertine&rsquo;s Daughter There.<span>&nbsp; </span>We talked a little bit about This money, and how It was with them.<span>&nbsp; </span>She had brought a letter, which she had received from You she said.<span>&nbsp; </span>Axel said he&rsquo;d let her see the letter that he and the Bank had gotten from Johan.<span>&nbsp; </span>And There It said precisely.<span>&nbsp; </span>These kroner are to be left in the Bank for as long as I shall live.<span>&nbsp; </span>But after my demise the amount is to be divided between my 4 surviving siblings There.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Widows were not mentioned.<span>&nbsp; </span>And Then Klara said that It was reasonable that It was divided like Johan had wanted it, and like It said in the letter.<span>&nbsp; </span>As for me I can&rsquo;t understand that Johan didn&rsquo;t say So in the letter, if he planned for Gjertine and Olava to be included too.<span>&nbsp; </span>But Klara also said There was nothing else to be done than What had been done.<span>&nbsp; </span>But like I&rsquo;ve said.<span>&nbsp; </span>In no way do we want to keep anything, that was meant for somebody else, if the deceased Johan said So and wanted it So.<span>&nbsp; </span>You ask how much duty There would be to pay on a doll.<span>&nbsp; </span>It would probably be quite a bit.<span>&nbsp; </span>And honestly Alma I want to say that you mustn&rsquo;t be thinking about sending a Doll.<span>&nbsp; </span>It will most probably be a little bit too Expensive, the way things are now.<span>&nbsp; </span>You must say hello to Your Mother from Hanna.<span>&nbsp; </span>She says many thanks for the gift and for The trouble she&rsquo;s had together with You over This money.<span>&nbsp; </span>There&rsquo;s no news here of interest.<span>&nbsp; </span>Only The fact that conflict and war are the topics of the day.<span>&nbsp; </span>The situation is serious, but we&rsquo;re glad that It&rsquo;s going well one day at a time.<span>&nbsp; </span>We hope and believe that both You and old Mother will do fine.<span>&nbsp; </span>And we hope that everything can be cleared up, so that no Misunderstanding will settle between us.<span>&nbsp; </span>If we&rsquo;ve done something wrong we would like to make all of it right.</p></p>\n<p>So keep well again and goodbye.<span>&nbsp; </span>We can greet You from all our children<span>&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;s almost full Winter here now.<span>&nbsp; </span>And the Polar Nights are very close.<span>&nbsp; </span>Christmas is coming soon, if we get to live, less than, two months till Christmas.<span>&nbsp; </span>Keep well Alma and You are warmly greeted.</p></p>\n<p>Hanna and Edv. Eidum</p></p>"
