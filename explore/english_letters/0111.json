      "<p>Dear Alma, John and the entire family</p></p>\n<p>Thank you so much for your letter.<span>&nbsp; </span>We received It yesterday on the 3<sup>rd</sup>.<span>&nbsp; </span>You are very good at remembering us.<span>&nbsp; </span>And I&rsquo;d only wish Alma that I were so near to You, that I could press You to my breast <em>(old fashioned way of saying &ldquo;give you a hug).</em><span>&nbsp; </span>Tears of Joy run from our eyes in cases like this. So a thousand thanks.<span>&nbsp; </span>There was a nice and good pair of shoes in the package.<span>&nbsp; </span>And Those Shoes my Daughter&rsquo;s son got.<span>&nbsp; </span>For he has no Sunday shoes.<span>&nbsp; </span>And he asked me to tell you thank You so much. Yes there are many packages that disappear.<span>&nbsp; </span>My sister Marie sent me a package a Month before Christmas.<span>&nbsp; </span>But It&rsquo;s gone, since It hasn&rsquo;t arrived by now.<span>&nbsp; </span>Oh how we regret The fact that It&rsquo;s gone.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Really.<span>&nbsp; </span>Is John already 79 now.<span>&nbsp; </span>And your Mother 80 ?<span>&nbsp; </span>Well There&rsquo;s proof that It&rsquo;s a healthy and strong stock. I see that You have some changes around There too.<span>&nbsp; </span>There are great changes everywhere here. There&rsquo;s quite a long distance beween Narvik and Stj&oslash;rdal or Hegra. It&rsquo;s 105 Norwegian Miles.<span>&nbsp; </span>Or 735 English Miles, So we don&rsquo;t meet every day.<span>&nbsp; </span>Hanna my wife is fairly well.<span>&nbsp; </span>She walks indoors without crutches or a Stick.<span>&nbsp; </span>But she hasn&rsquo;t been outside yet.<span>&nbsp; </span>If Baltzer hadn&rsquo;t been with the Railroad as a Blacksmith, He would have gone to America.<span>&nbsp; </span>But as he has a permanent position There he&rsquo;ll probably stay There.<span>&nbsp; </span>In my next letter You&rsquo;ll get a picture of me too. <span>&nbsp;</span>I was just to the photographer&rsquo;s.<span>&nbsp; </span>But Hanna couldn&rsquo;t come.<span>&nbsp; </span>She wanted to wait till Summer Comes.<span>&nbsp; </span>We&rsquo;ve had letters from everybody in Stj&oslash;rdal.<span>&nbsp; </span>From ours as well as the Holm&rsquo;s.<span>&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;ll be fun to see Them this Summer.<span>&nbsp; </span>But They&rsquo;re all well, Except for Aksel&rsquo;s Wife Helga. <span>&nbsp;</span>She she <em>(written twice)</em> suffers from Tuberculosis (consumption) and is probably finished soon.<span>&nbsp; </span>But she&rsquo;s ready to travel, and Then It feels good to move.<span>&nbsp; </span>You ask what Church we belong to..<span>&nbsp; </span>We belong to the Methodist Church.<span>&nbsp; </span>We&rsquo;ve been There since 1916.<span>&nbsp; </span>We like it very much There, and I&rsquo;ve been out Preaching several times both here in Norway and Sweden.<span>&nbsp; </span>Also planned to go to Palestine <em>(he calls it Jew-land, or Jew Country, which is what it was commonly called by Norwegians back then)</em> for a Year.<span>&nbsp; </span>But That trip I was able to change again.<span>&nbsp; </span>I have also built two churches here in Norway.<span>&nbsp; </span>And one of Them I&rsquo;ve worked in for many Years.<span>&nbsp; </span>I had leave from the Railroad at the Time.<span>&nbsp; </span>I can&rsquo;t remember if I&rsquo;ve told You the Names of our children.<span>&nbsp; </span>The oldest is Ole, Car Mechanic.<span>&nbsp; </span>The second is Olaf.<span>&nbsp; </span>He&rsquo;s a stoker at the Railroad.<span>&nbsp; </span>No Karen is between Ole and Olaf.<span>&nbsp; </span>She&rsquo;s a policeman&rsquo;s wife.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then there&rsquo;s Gusta, she&rsquo;s now at home.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then Erling.<span>&nbsp; </span>He&rsquo;s also a stoker at the Railroad in Trondhjem.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then Aagodt.<span>&nbsp; </span>She&rsquo;s a farmer <em>(he uses the English word farmer here, he probably means to say that she lives on a farm).</em><span>&nbsp; </span>Her Husband is an Agronomist.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then Sverre.<span>&nbsp; </span>He&rsquo;s a Goldsmith.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then Hilma.<span>&nbsp; </span>Also Farmer or Agriculturer.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then Baltzer.<span>&nbsp; </span>He&rsquo;s a Blacksmith.<span>&nbsp; </span>All of them are Married except Gusta.<span>&nbsp; </span><em>(It looks like he has forgotten one, as he mentions in a previous letter that they have 10 children).</em><span>&nbsp; </span>Greet Holm from me and tell him he&rsquo;ll soon get a letter from us again.<span>&nbsp; </span>But now I had to write to You first, because I&rsquo;m really fond of You Alma. <span>&nbsp;</span>Forgive me for using That expression.<span>&nbsp; </span>I mean It honestly.<span>&nbsp; </span>Keep well again then all of you. And once again.<span>&nbsp; </span>Many thanks for everything we have received.<span>&nbsp; </span>You can be sure that every thread is well utilized.<span>&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;ll probably be a long time before we can buy anything here.<span>&nbsp; </span>Of my 3 Radioes I still haven&rsquo;t gotten any back <em>(I assume he&rsquo;s talking about the radioes that were taken away from them by the Nazis during the war; it was illegal to have one).</em><span>&nbsp; </span>May the lord our God bless you all richly.<span>&nbsp; </span>May Jesus our saviour be allowed to walk by us every day, as long as we are here in this World.<span>&nbsp; </span>Greet everyone warmly from us.<span>&nbsp; </span>Hanna turns 70 years old on The 20<sup>th</sup> of May.<span>&nbsp; </span>And I&rsquo;ll be 67 in October, if I get to live.<span>&nbsp; </span>Greetings with Joh. Revelations 7.<span>&nbsp; </span>9-17.<span>&nbsp; </span>E. Eidum <span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p></p>"
