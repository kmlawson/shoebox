I do not think he became aware of the train until too late.<span>&nbsp; </span>Poor Markus what an end he got.<span>&nbsp; </span>I spoke to him the night before, while visiting out there.<span>&nbsp; </span>He has 6 unconfirmed children but it seems his Wife will receive a good pension from the State and also support from the Union and privately so she will be well provided for.<span>&nbsp; </span>Here at home everything is otherwise fine.<span>&nbsp; </span>&ldquo;Father&rdquo; likes being at M. Dybvad&rsquo;s and is doing well, all the others are also fine.<span>&nbsp; </span>There&rsquo;s a lot of unemployment and high prices here, so it&rsquo;s not easy to keep it going.<span>&nbsp; </span>I have been unemployed all through this fall, and things will probably get worse here, as long as the War goes on.<span>&nbsp; </span>Hope that all Germans would be murdered soon so that there could be peace.</p></p>\n<p>Hope everything is fine with you all and that everybody is doing well.<span>&nbsp; </span>How are the times over there?<span>&nbsp; </span>Hope you will write and tell me how you all are doing.</p></p>\n<p>Greet all the young generation, hope Hilda or Cleo(?) writes me soon.<span>&nbsp; </span>I have no other news so I must close for this time</p></p>\n<p>with the heartiest regard</p></p>\n<p>Yours Ole</p></p>\n<p>Adr Rosenborgsgt. 14</p></p>\n<p>Trondhjem</p></p>\n<p>Norway <span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p></p>"
