      "<p>First I must wish you and yours a very happy &ldquo;New Year&rdquo;. Well I&rsquo;m up a little bit these days<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;ve been sick in bed for about 6-7 weeks, am far from well yet, but up a little bit.<span>&nbsp; </span>I&rsquo;m not able do anything yet, but hope to improve with the weather.<span>&nbsp; </span>We&rsquo;re having such impossible weather.<span>&nbsp; </span>Sandstorms and cold wind every day, no snow yet this winer but this is terribly unhealthy<span>&nbsp; </span>Well today a &ldquo;Pacakge&rdquo; arrived with Suit No. 2<span>&nbsp; </span>I received one while I was sick.<span>&nbsp; </span>They are really good items but I&rsquo;m so sad that They are so small<span>&nbsp; </span>the one I got today, I may be able to wear in the summertime, when I don&rsquo;t wear much underneath but we have very few days that are that warm, and they had such a nice and solid material in them so they were grand, the first one is too small for Axel too, but I do have people around me who can use them.<span>&nbsp; </span>I have 5 Sons in law you know, so it&rsquo;s extremely welcome especially now.<span>&nbsp; </span>I have earned nothing the past 2 months.<span>&nbsp; </span>Everything is very welcome.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Shirt Suspenders, the Axe and the Knife were very good things.<span>&nbsp; </span>Yes it&rsquo;s good of you to remember us here.</p></p>\n<p>We&rsquo;re starting to get some goods now, but everything is so terribly expensive and it probably is there too.<span>&nbsp; </span>The world is bewitched you know, and it will probably get worse, here in Western Europe where Kapitalists and Military persons reign.</p></p>\n<p>Well so much for that, how is &ldquo;your Health&rdquo; are you fairly well.<span>&nbsp; </span>I think about you so much day and night, when one gets that old the order to travel can arrive soon you know, so it&rsquo;s good to have everything ready.<span>&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;s time for you too to &ldquo;take it easy, as the tr&oslash;nder <span>&nbsp;</span>said&rdquo;(a tr&oslash;nder is someone from Tr&oslash;ndelag), you have certainly worked enough in your life.<span>&nbsp; </span>This is what I tell my siblings here, that there&rsquo;s hardly a living human being who has worked, as much as you have, in your time, so you deserve to rest in your old days.</p></p>\n<p>Axel was here recently<span>&nbsp; </span>everything is the same, and well, so also with all others of ours, and that&rsquo;s good.<span>&nbsp; </span>So I have no news.<span>&nbsp; </span>I had a letter from Florence, the other day<span>&nbsp; </span>I see she&rsquo;s been sick too, it must be sad for her, who&rsquo;s alone. I&rsquo;ve heard nothing from Halvor Oien<span>&nbsp; </span>I guess I&rsquo;ll have to get going and write first.</p></p>\n<p>I think I&rsquo;ll have to quit for now<span>&nbsp; </span>am tired.</p></p>\n<p>I feel it&rsquo;s so simple and little to say &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; for all the good things, you&rsquo;re sending me, but that&rsquo;s all I can do, but I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll be blessed for everything one day.<span>&nbsp; </span>So thank you so much then for every every thing then my dear good brother<span>&nbsp; </span>all of mine send their best wishes.<span>&nbsp; </span>The wife is fairly well again, but is starting to get old and tired.</p></p>\n<p>Well, live well then.<span>&nbsp; </span>greet the Wife and Alma so much from me, and you get my warmest greetings and a thousand thanks</p></p>\n<p>Your brother Olav. <span>&nbsp;</span></p></p>"
